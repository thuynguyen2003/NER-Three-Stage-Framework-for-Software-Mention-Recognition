DTI and Ki 67 Immunohistological Screening of Human Tissue : Twenty - four samples of adult human brain white matter of normal appearance were obtained from planned resections during anterior temporal lobectomy for the treatment of intractable epilepsy .
The procedures were conducted at Hospital La Fe ( Valencia , Spain ) and were performed with informed patient consent that provided their written consent to participate and in accordance with the medical and science ethics board ( Comite Etico de Investigacon Biomedica del hospital Universitario La FE ( CEIB ) ) that specifically approved the present study .
In order to ensure the absence of abnormalities in the tissue samples used in the present study , we first analysed the samples with two different techniques : pre - surgical diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) and automatised Ki 67 immunostaining .
DTI was used to infer ultrastructural changes in brain white matter tissue according to the diffusion of water molecules .
The diffusion - weighted images from all the patients included in this study were acquired using a single - shot echo - planar imaging pulse sequence with the following parameters : TR / TE of 10.100 / 102 , acquisition matrix of 128 × 128 , FOV of 250 mm , in - plane resolution of 2 × 2 mm and contiguous 2 - mm slice thickness , 70 contiguous axial slices , and a voxel volume of 1.95 × 1.95 × 2 mm .
The images were acquired with diffusion weighting in 30 non - collinear directions , all with a b value ( diffusion weighting factor ) of 1000 s / mm 2 .
In addition , an image with no diffusion weighting ( b value of 0 s / mm 2 ) was acquired as a reference .
The DTI images were analysed using DTV.II SR toolbox software ( Image Computing and Analysis Laboratory [ UTRAD / ICAL ] Department of Radiology , The University of Tokyo Hospital , extension of Volume 1 , package [ http://www.volume-one.org/ ] ) with the following parameters to determine the degree of sensitivity for generating DTI tracts : Fractional Anisotropy ( FA ) = 0.05 , steps = 160 ; Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ( ADC ) ( x1K ) : any ; So < 80 ; Angle : any .
The Ki 67 immunohistochemistry was performed on a benchmark ULTRA using clone 30 - 9 ( Ventana Medical Systems , Tucson , AZ ) , and interpreted with an iScan Coreo and Virtuoso algorithm ( Ventana Medical Systems ) .
A histopathological analysis of the tissue samples was performed to validate their use in the rest of the study .
The architectural disorganisation of the cortex and neuronal heterotopia were studied using NeuN immunostaining .
Microglia activation was examined by Iba - 1 marking .
The experiments were performed using the protocols described later .
Cell Isolation Protocol and Culture : All samples were processed within 12 hours of extraction following a previously described protocol [24] .
Briefly , brain white matter was macroscopically separated from temporal grey matter ( Figure S1 ) , minced , and washed in HBSS ( Hanks balanced salt solution ) w / o Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + .
Enzymatic digestion was sequentially performed with Solution I ( Papain [ 14 U / mL , Sigma ] and DNase I [ 10 U / mL , Sigma ] in PIPES solution ) for 90 minutes at 37 ° C and Solution II ( Papain [ 7 U / mL ] and DNase I [ 15 U / mL ] in PIPES : proliferative media [ 1 ∶ 1 ] ) for 30 minutes at 37 ° C .
The cells were then dissociated using diameter - decreasing polished Pasteur pipettes and filtered through a 70 - μ m mesh .
Foetal bovine serum ( 10 % , Invitrogen ) was added to stop enzymatic digestion .
In 10 of the processed samples , the tissue disaggregates were resuspended in 0.9 M sucrose in 0.5x HBSS w / o Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + and centrifuged at 750 g for 10 minutes [25] .
The dissociated cells were resuspended in defined proliferative media and were maintained using standard procedures .
Four viable cell cultures were obtained without sucrose gradient separation and 10 cell lines from the procedure with sucrose gradient .
The dissociated cells were resuspended in defined proliferative media composed of DMEM - F12 , non - essential amino acids ( 100 μ m ) , HEPES ( 2 mM ) , D - glucose ( 30 mM ) , bovine serum albumin ( 0.001 % ) , sodium pyruvate ( 1 mM ) , l - glutamine ( 2 mM ) , N2 supplement ( 1X ) , penicillin - streptomycin - fungizone ( 1X ) ( all from Gibco - Invitrogen ) ; and hydrocortisone ( 300 ng / mL ) and triiodothyronine ( 30 ng / mL ) from Sigma .
The medium was supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) ( 10 ng / mL , Sigma ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( 10 ng / mL , Sigma ) , and was replaced every two days .
When the cells growing in the monolayer adherent culture reached a confluence near 90 % , a subculture was performed using Triple Express ( Invitrogen ) for 5 minutes at 37 ° C .
The cells were reseeded at a density of 2000 cells / cm 2 in 25 cm 2 culture flasks .
Using this procedure , all the cell lines could be expanded for at least seven passages .
The sphere - like clusters obtained using the protocol with the sucrose centrifugation were passaged before becoming necrotic by mechanical disaggregation with polished Pasteur pipettes , and planted at 3000 cells / cm 2 on 24 - well plates .
All the cell lines could give rise to tertiary neurospheres .
Additionally , adherent culture colonies derived from neurosphere cultures were subcultured separately according to monolayer culture protocol , and were able to reach a minimum of five passages .
Three adherent culture cell lines produced by the spheres were seeded on ultra - low attachment at a density of 3000 cells / cm 2 , with or without 100 - μ M β - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma ) to test if they were able to regenerate floating cultures [26] .
Viability was studied using Calcein / I Propidium iodide .
After two weeks , the cells were seeded on Matrigel - coated coverslips , cultured for 24 hours , and fixed for SOX 2 immunostaining ( Figure 1A displays a schematic representation of the different cell cultures ) .

Diagram depicting the different procedures followed in the present work for the isolation of proliferative cells from human white matter .
B .
The cell isolation protocol without ( w / o ) the sucrose centrifugation step gives rise to a monolayer culture , which could be expanded more than seven passages .
However , only 28.57 % of samples generated viable cultures with this procedure ( B ) .
Therefore , we added a final sucrose centrifugation , which allowed the obtaining of sphere - like colonies lightly adhered to the culture plate from all samples processed ( D ) .
These cells generated an adherent culture that could be expanded independently for more than five passages ( E ) .
When the initial spheres were passaged and reseeded at a cell density of 3000 cells / cm 2 or higher , new spheres were obtained ( C ) , which , in turn , generated a new monolayer culture .
These spheres could be passaged up to tertiary spheres , similarly to other proliferative cells isolated from adult human white matter .
The scale bars represent 50 μ m .
Spontaneous differentiation was assayed on small spheres formed two days after disaggregation , corresponding to four samples in triplicate .
The spheres were seeded on matrigel - coated coverslips and maintained in growth media for 14 days prior to fixation .
A protocol directed to induce final oligodendroglial differentiation was tested in four samples in triplicate as previously described .
The spheres were disaggregated into a single - cell suspension and seeded on a Matrigel - coated coverslip .
The cells were maintained in an oligodendrocyte proliferative medium until confluence , composed of DMEM - F12 , non - essential amino acids ( 100 μ m ) , HEPES ( 2 mM ) , D - glucose ( 30 mM ) , bovine serum albumin ( 0.001 % ) , sodium pyruvate ( 1 mM ) , l - glutamine ( 2 mM ) , N2 supplement ( 1X ) , and penicillin - streptomycin - fungizone ( 1X ) , all of which were acquired from Gibco - Invitrogen .
The medium also included progesterone ( 300 ng / mL ) and sodium selenite ( 30 ng / mL ) , which were acquired from Sigma .
The medium was supplemented with bFGF ( 20 ng / mL , Sigma ) , platelet - derived growth factor alpha ( PDGFa , 20 ng / mL , Sigma ) , and Neurotrophin - 3 ( 2 ng / mL , Sigma ) .
The medium was replaced every two days .
When the cells reached confluence , the medium was supplemented with foetal bovine serum ( 2 % , Gibco ) and triiodothyronine ( 30 ng / mL , Sigma ) , and the cells were maintained one more week prior to fixation .
Twenty - four hours after cell isolation with the protocol , including the centrifugation in the sucrose solution , three cell samples were lightly disaggregated with polished Pasteur pipettes and washed once with 0.1 M PBS .
The cell suspension was then incubated in A2B 5 hybridoma supernatant ( ATCC ) for 30 minutes at 4 ° C , washed with 0.1 M PBS , 0.5 % bovine serum albumin three times , and finally incubated in a secondary antibody ( Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse , 1 ∶ 500 in 0.1 M PBS [ Invitrogen ] ) and propidium iodide .
After a final wash , the samples were analysed using a Cytomics FC 500 ( Beckman Coulter ) flow cytometer .
The total RNA was extracted from three cell lines of each culture type in passage 2 ( spheres ) or passage 3 ( adherent cultures ) using RNeasy , followed by DNase I treatment , both according to the manufacturer ’ s specifications ( Qiagen ) .
The cDNA was synthesised using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) .
The molecular analyses were performed by PCR amplification , using primers designed with Primer 3 software ( Table S1 ) , followed by electrophoresis in 1.8 % agarose gel .
SYBR Green - based QRT - PCR ( Applied Biosystems ) was run in a LightCycler 480 Instrument ( Roche ) .
The amount of SOX 2 cDNA was normalised to the quantity of three housekeeping gene ( β - actin , β - 2 - microglobulin , and GAPDH ) transcripts .
The cells were plated for 24 hours on Matrigel - treated coverslips , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB ( Panreac ) for 20 minutes , and washed with Dulbecco ’ s phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS , Invitrogen ) w / o Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + .
The cells were blocked with 10 % donkey serum ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) and 0.1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) in 0.1 M DPBS for 45 minutes .
Goat anti - human SOX 2 antibody ( 1 ∶ 50 , Chemicon ) , mouse anti - GFAP ( 1 ∶ 500 , Dako ) , mouse anti - MAP 2 ( 1 ∶ 200 , Sigma ) , rat anti - MBP ( 1 ∶ 200 , Sigma ) , and / or mouse anti - human Ki 67 antibodies ( Dako , 1 ∶ 250 ) were applied for 1 hour at 25 ° C in a blocking solution .
For Ki 67 immunostaining ( rabbit anti - human Ki 67 , 1 ∶ 250 , Dako ) , antigen retrieval was previously performed by exposing coverslips to boiling 10 mM sodium citrate , 0.05 % Tween 20 , pH 6.0 for 15 minutes .
A2B 5 and O4 immunostaining was performed using live cells .
The cells were washed , blocked with 5 % goat serum in 0.1 M DPBS for 30 minutes at 4 ° C and incubated in primary antibody ( A2B 5 clone 105 hybridoma supernatant [ ATCC , 1 ∶ 1 ] ; anti O4 [ Millipore , 1 ∶ 50 ] ) for 45 minutes at 4 ° C .
After washing , the cells were fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 minutes and washed with 0.1 M DPBS .
Finally , for all cases , after washing , secondary antibodies were applied for 1 hour in DPBS ( Texas Red donkey anti - goat antibody , 1 ∶ 150 ; DyLight 488 Donkey anti - mouse , 1 ∶ 400 [ both from Jackson InmunoResearch ] ; Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse IgM , 1 ∶ 500 ; Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti - goat , 1 ∶ 500 ; Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - rat , 1 ∶ 500 ; Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti - rabbit , 1 ∶ 500 ; Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti - mouse , 1 ∶ 500 [ all purchased from Invitrogen ] ) .
The cells were washed , counterstained with DAPI , and mounted with FluorSave ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) .
The same procedure was performed for U373 cells and / or glioblastoma multiforme cells as a positive control .
The images were collected with a Leica TCS SP 2 AOBS ( Leica Microsystems ) inverted laser scanning confocal microscope .
All the confocal images were obtained under identical scan settings .
Eight - bit , 1024 × 1024 - pixel images were collected for each preparation .
The best focus was based on the highest pixel intensity .
Imaging conditions were identical for all the images .
The images were identically processed using MetaMorph Software ( Molecular Devices ) .
For the cell recount , at least 10 different images ( including at least five spheres , depending on their size ) from three separate experiments were counted .
Sections from four temporal lobe samples were fixed with 4 % PFA for 36 hours .
After washing , the sections were cryoprotected in a 30 % sucrose solution overnight and cryosectioned at 14 μ m .
The sections were washed with 0.1 M PBS , and antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the sample in 10 mM sodium citrate , 0.05 % Tween 20 , pH 6.0 at 95 ° C - 100 ° C for 1 hour .
After permeabilisation treatment with 0.2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 45 minutes , autofluorescence was partially blocked using Sudan black staining .
The sections were incubated overnight at 4 ° C with goat anti - human SOX 2 ( 1 ∶ 25 in PBS ; Chemicon ) , alone or in combination with mouse anti - Ki 67 ( 1 ∶ 250 , Dako ) , mouse anti - GFAP ( 1 ∶ 200 , Abcam ) , mouse anti - NeuN ( 1 ∶ 800 ) , rabbit anti - Iba - 1 ( 1 ∶ 200 , Wako ) , or mouse anti - CNPase ( 1 ∶ 200 , Sigma ) .
The samples were then washed and labelled with appropriate secondary antibodies ( Texas Red - conjugated donkey anti - goat antibody ( 1 ∶ 150 ) and DyLight - conjugated Donkey anti - mouse antibody ( 1 ∶ 400 ) [ both from Jackson ImmunoResearch ] ; Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit antibody [ 1 ∶ 500 , Molecular Probes ] ) for 1 hour at room temperature .
After washing , the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and sections were mounted with FluorSave ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) .

We conducted a retrospective cohort study comprising adult patients admitted to Soroka University Medical Center ( SUMC ) with a primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) ; ( ICD - 9 codes 411.81 ( ACS ) , 411.1 ( unstable angina , UA ) , 410.9 , 410 ( acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) , non ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) , ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) ) between 2001 and 2010 .
SUMC is the only medical center in this area serving a population of approximately 700,000 as the primary hospital and nearly 1 million as a tertiary hospital .
The study area is inhabited by two main ethnic groups : predominantly urban Jews ( 69 % ) and rural Bedouin Arabs ( 31 % ) .
The following patient level data were obtained using the centralized electronic medical records database : diabetes ( ICD - 9 code 250 ) , history of MI ( ICD - 9 code 410 - 414 ) , hypertension ( ICD - 9 code ) , chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) ( ICD - 9 code 490 , 491 , 492 , 496 ) and socio - demographic data such as gender , age and ethnicity ( Jews vs . Bedouin Arabs ) .
The study was approved by the institutional review board of Soroka University Medical Center .
Patient information was anonymized and de - identified prior to analysis , therefore written informed consent was not obtained .
Data for the study period included PM 10 concentrations ( μ g / m3 ) , NO 2 ( μ g / m3 ) , meteorological parameters ( temperature ( CO ) and relative humidity ( % ) ) obtained from monitor station in Be ' er - Sheva operated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection .
This is the only monitoring station in the area recording all pollutants simultaneously in 20 minute intervals .
The monitoring station is located in a typical neighborhood in the center of Be ’ er - Sheba ( the city area is about 20 km 2 ) .
Thus , we have limited our population to reside within 20km radius .
Seasons were defined according to Alpert et al . : [16] winter ( December 7 - March 30 ) , summer ( May 31 - September 22 ) each last about 4 months ( 3 months and 23 days ) , autumn ( September 23 - December 6 ) and spring ( March 31 - May 30 ) each lasts only 2 months ( 75 days and 61 days , respectively ) .
The primary source of PM 10 pollution in the region is non - anthropogenic .
Most of the dust storms in the Negev region originate from the North Africa .
Strong dust storms can last from several hours to few days .
The daily average concentration of atmospheric PM 10 can reach more than 2000 μ g / m3 , with hourly concentrations as high as 5000 μ g m3 .
We defined a dust storm ( DS ) day as a day with an averaged PM 10 concentration that was two standard deviations ( SD ) above the background value [14] .
The background value was calculated on the basis of the average PM 10 concentration for 12 - hour period ( from 6 am to 6 pm ) during the summer season ( dust free period ) .
It reflected the background level inclusive of non - anthropogenic and anthropogenic sourced particles [17] .
Furthermore , we have validated the definition of dust storm by examination in details of the back - trajectories and synoptic conditions during the dust day to confirm that the origins of the dust were external to the region .
The resulting threshold value for a dust day was 71 μ g / m3 [14] .
The statistical analysis involved two steps .
First , generalized additive Poisson regression models ( GAM ) were used to test a possible non - linear association of PM 10 on incidence of ACS .
To adjust for seasons and other temporal effects in GAM models , we used a non - linear terms with penalized splines for time with five degrees of freedom per year .
Similarly , we used the same approach with five degrees of freedom for average temperature to adjust for a possible non - linear effect of temperature .
The aim of the second step was to test the modification of the effect of PM 10 on the ACS risk by different co morbidities ( diabetes , history of MI , hypertension , COPD ) and demographic factors ( age and gender and ethnicity ) .
This analysis followed a case crossover procedure where each subject with event contributes information as a case and as matched control during nonevents times [18] .
We used two different methods of case definitions ( exposure period ) ; ( 1 ) case period was defined as the hospitalization day , while for the control period we used every third day either before or after the hospitalization day within the same calendar month [19] ( 2 ) case and control period defined as fix periods of 8 weeks strata ( a month from a hospitalization day , bidirectional ) .
The case period defined as three days mean of pollution ending on the hospitalization day ( lag 0 - 2 ) .
The control periods were chosen to end on the same week - day as a hospitalization day during the weeks before and after the hospitalization ( four before and four after the case period ) .
For example , if the hospitalization occurred on Monday ; the three day ’ s mean PM 10 concentrations were compared to eight similar periods on preceding and following Mondays .
Both strategies belong to symmetric bidirectional case crossover design where control periods are symmetrically spaced in time minimizing the potential time - varying confounders by season or secular trends [20] .
Conditional logistic regression models were conducted to analyze the exposure odds ratio ( ORs ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) on risk of ACS hospitalization .
To investigate the potential modification of the effect of PM 10 on the ACS risk by different co morbidities and demographic factors , we simultaneously added to the model sets of 2 - way and 3 - way interaction terms that expressed the impact of PM 10 measurement among vulnerable population ( demographic and clinical personal characteristics ; diabetes , history of MI , hypertension , COPD , gender , age and ethnicity ( Jews vs . Bedouin Arabs ) ) .
We controlled for daily mean temperature and humidity , indicator of the day of the week for the first case definition method and an indicator variable of month ( 1 ; 31 ) additionally included in the models based on the second case definition method .
We performed a stratified analysis to compare the magnitude of the effect among different patients with STEMI ( ST elevation myocardial infarction ) and NSTEMI ( non ST - elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) .
Analyses were performed using R statistical software , version 3.0 .
The experiments were approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the University of Wollongong ( approval number HE 10 / 120 ) .
All subjects participated voluntarily and gave informed written consent .
Research was conducted in accordance with the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki .
Participants were 10 undergraduate and graduate students ( the undergraduate students received course credit for their participation ) , and the two authors .
All had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and reported no vestibular disorders or deficits .
The stimuli were programmed on a Mac Pro computer ( Mac Pro 3.1 , Quad - Core Intel Xeon 2.8 GHz ) using Matlab Version R 2009b and Psychtoolbox [57] , [58] , and displayed using a Mitsubishi Electric colour data projector ( Model XD 400U ) back - projected onto large ( 1.48 m wide by 1.20 m high ) screen mounted on the lab wall .
Subjects viewed stimuli through black - lined viewing tube fronted by a rectangular black cardboard frame , at a distance of 1.53 m from the screen , to give a field of view of 44 degrees horizontally and 26 degrees vertically .
Stimuli were random clouds consisting of 1000 blue circular dots , moving in a radially expanding fashion ( see Demo Movies S1 and S2 ) , within a virtual cloud of dots simulating a “ world ” 30 by 30 by 80 m .
Subjects were seated on a raised chair in front of the viewing tube .
Their eye - height on this chair coincided with the focus of expansion of the optic flow display .
During the experiment the windowless room was darkened and any external sources of light were minimised ( e.g. by turning off the external monitor , etc ) .
Participants were asked to compare smooth radially - expanding flow ( travelling at a simulated MID speed of 4 m / s ) with radially - expanding flow that contained a vertically oscillating component ( oscillation magnitude was 1 / 8 of the MID speed , or 0.5 m , and the frequency was 2 Hz ) .
Each interval was a 1 - second long motion display , and there was a 300 ms gap between stimulus presentations .
The stimulus length of 1 second was specifically chosen as being too short to induce vection , as it is well established that it is not possible to induce illusory vection in stationary observers with display presentations under 3 seconds [7] , [43] .
Participants were specifically instructed to ignore the vertical motion and just match the stimuli for MID .
Presentation was in a two - interval forced choice paradigm , with two randomly interleaved staircases where the speed of the smooth motion was manipulated using QUEST [59] .
Responses were collected using a mouse button press , with participants responding with the left mouse button if the first interval looked faster , and the right button if the second looked faster .
Each trial proceeded after a decision for the previous trial had been made .
Participants each ran two blocks of two interleaved staircases comprising 25 trials each , giving a total of 100 trials for each participant .
Results were then fitted with cumulative Gaussian psychometric functions using custom Matlab code , to give a value for each subject ' s point of subjective equality ( PSE ) for the speed of smooth radial flow that matched the perceived speed of the oscillating flow .
This value was then used in Experiment 1.2 to present individually speed - matched displays for each participant .
Experiment 1.2 : Vection measurements for smooth , oscillating and speed - matched stimuli : Stimuli and apparatus were as described above , but displays were now presented for longer periods of time , 30 s per trial .
Participants were given a throttle control device [ CH Pro USB throttle ] and , after being given a basic description of vection , were asked to move the throttle forwards , if and when they felt that they were moving , to rate the extent to which they felt they were moving ( and specifically not the speed of their self - motion ) , and to move it back if they felt they were moving less or had stopped moving ; the device had tactile marking points ( small raised bumps at 0 , 50 and 100 % positions ) , to assist participants in rating vection strength .
The computer was programmed to require the throttle to be reset to 0 before the next trial could proceed .
Latency for experiencing vection was calculated as the number of seconds before the throttle value reached a threshold of 5 % ; throttle maximum was defined as the maximum value that the throttle reached during each 30 second trial ( see Figure 4 ) .
After each trial , participants were also asked to also give a verbal rating of their vection experience , from 0 ( no self - motion ) to 10 ( complete self - motion ) ; this was followed by a blank period of 5 seconds to help reduce any residual effects of adaptation .
Three types of trials were randomly interleaved : smooth radial motion at 4 m / s ( ‘ slow ’ ) , smooth radial motion moving at the individually - chosen speed that matched the perceived MID speed of the oscillating stimuli ( ‘ speed - matched ’ ) , and oscillating radial flow moving at 4 m / s and oscillating at 2 Hz , as described above ( ‘ oscillating ’ ) .
Each stimulus type was presented 4 times , and there were 2 sessions , giving a total of 8 trials per stimulus type for each participant .
Experiment 2.1 : Speed comparison for jittering stimuli : Participants were 8 undergraduate and graduate students ( the undergraduate students received course credit for their participation ) , and the two authors .
All had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and reported no vestibular disorders or deficits .
These jittering radial flow displays were exactly as above , with the single exception that , instead of smooth vertical sine - wave oscillation , the stimuli were programmed to simulate random vertical viewpoint jitter , with the virtual camera moving vertically to a new , randomly - generated location every 3 frames .
Since both the magnitude and the sign of this jitter varied randomly from one jittering frame to the next , it is best represented as a range of frequencies , extending from zero to the capping frequency ( 10 Hz ) convolved with the impulse response of the display .
The amplitude of this jitter was half of that reported above for the sine wave oscillation , as pilot testing showed that this jitter amplitude produced the most realistic display motion .
See Demo Movie S3 for an illustration of the jittering stimulus .
Experiment 2.2 : Vection measurements for smooth , jittering and speed - matched stimuli : Experiment 2.2 was run exactly as described in Experiment 1.2 , with the single exception that jittering displays ( as described above ) were used in place of oscillating displays .
Experiment 3 : Speed discrimination for all MID stimuli : Participants were 8 postgraduate students and the two authors ( mean age 29.1 , SD 8.65 ; 5 males ) .
All had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and reported no vestibular disorders or deficits .
The stimuli were smooth - moving , oscillating or jittering radial flow displays , exactly as described above , projected onto a large screen .
The experiment was run as in Experiments 1.1 and 2.1 , as a speed discrimination experiment , with the stimuli being presented in 1 - second intervals interleaved with a 300 - ms gap , and a mouse button used to provide the 2AFC response ( which interval contained faster MID ? ) .
Two randomly - interleaved QUEST staircases were used , with 25 trials each , and each participant ran two blocks of each condition , giving a total of 100 trials for each speed discrimination .
We ran 4 m / s smooth , 4 m / s jittering , 4 m / s oscillating , and 6 m / s smooth conditions - the faster condition was set between the averages of perceived speed increase for oscillating and jittering conditions , with the expectation that speed discrimination threshold might rise with either actual or perceived speed , which might throw some light on the results for vection .
Growth stimulation of ‘ difficult - to - culture ’ oral bacterial strains by siderophores : Lawn cultures of Prevotella sp . HOT - 376 ( KCL - E7 _ 34 ) were prepared by inoculating plates of Fastidious Anaerobe Agar ( FAA , Lab M , UK ) with 50 μ l suspensions ( McFarland standard 1 turbidity ) , prepared from a four - day plate culture .
Plates of blood Agar Base No . 2 ( Lab M , UK ) + 5 % horse blood ( BA ) were inoculated with 50 μ l suspensions ( McFarland standard 4 ) of Fretibacterium fastidiosum DSM 25557T from a seven - day plate culture .
Test agents were placed in a central well in each plate in 1.5 , 15 or 150 μ g amounts .
The agents tested included the siderophores desferricoprogen ( EMC Microcollections , Germany ) , pyoverdines - Fe - complex ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) and ferrichrome - Fe - free ( Santa Cruz , USA ) ; siderophore - like molecules 2 , 3 - dihydroxybenzoic acid ( Acros Organics , Belgium ) and salicylic acid ( ChemCruz Biochemicals , USA ) ; and the iron chelator ferric citrate ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) .
The positive control was filtered supernatant of a 72 - hr broth culture of F . nucleatum and negative controls were the agent diluents .
Plates were incubated in an anaerobic workstation ( Don Whitley Scientific Ltd . ) with an atmosphere of 80 % nitrogen , 10 % hydrogen and 10 % carbon dioxide at 37 ° C for up to 35 days .
The diameter and relative density of any zone of growth were recorded , and used to arbitrarily grade growth stimulation relative to positive ( + + + + ) and negative controls ( - ) .
The experiment was performed in triplicate .
Development of an in - vitro culture model for the cultivation and isolation of previously - uncultivated oral bacteria : Four subjects with chronic periodontitis , none of whom had received periodontal or antimicrobial therapy within the previous three months , were recruited for the study with their informed written consent .
Ethical approval was granted by the South West London REC 3 Research Ethics Committee ( REF : 10 / H0803 / 161 ) .
Subgingival plaque samples were collected with a sterile curette from two deep ( 7 - 9 mm ) periodontal pockets from each subject , pooled and suspended in Reduced Transport Medium ( RTM ) [35] .
Samples were transported to an anaerobic workstation within 1 hr of collection .
After vortexing for 1 min , a 10 - fold dilution series of each sample was prepared in RTM .
Pre - reduced BA plates were inoculated with 50 μ l of each 102 - , 105 - and 106 - diluted plaque suspension .
150 μ l neat plaque suspension ( matched to the plaque that was diluted and used for culture ) , 15 μ g siderophore ( pyoverdines - Fe or desferricoprogen ) , or 150 μ l sterile water ( negative control ) were added to a central well in the plates , and plates were incubated anaerobically .
Sub - culture and identification of colonies of interest in mixed cultures : After 8 - 28 days of incubation , culture plates were inspected under a dissecting microscope and any colonies of interest ( namely microcolonies or colonies showing satellitism : growing either around or on larger colonies ) were passaged onto : ( a ) fresh BA plates , cross - streaked with helper strains ( Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919 , Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum NCTC 10562 , or colonies in proximity to the colonies of interest ) and where relevant , supplemented with either pyoverdines - Fe or desferricoprogen ; or ( b ) cellulose acetate membranes overlying lawn cultures of the helper strains .
Once pure , sub - cultured colonies were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing with primer 519R ( as described previously [36] ) after PCR of extracted DNA or ‘ touch ’ - PCR of single colonies with ‘ universal ’ primers 27FYM and 1492R [37] .
For any taxa : ( a ) found to have less than 98.5 % similarity to 16S rRNA gene sequences in the Human Oral Microbiome ( HOMD ) and GenBank nucleotide databases , or ( b ) with more than 98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to previously - uncultivated phylotypes , clone libraries were prepared ( as described previously [36] ) from amplicons representing 16S rRNA gene ‘ touch ’ - PCR of single colonies with ‘ universal ’ primers ; and 20 clone inserts were sequenced per library to confirm purity .
The full length of the 16S rRNA gene for any such novel taxon was sequenced with multiple primers for triple coverage [36] .
Pyrosequencing analysis of subgingival plaque samples before and after culture : 500 μ l of neat plaque suspension from subjects SP 9 and SP 10 were subjected to propidium monoazide ( PMA ) treatment prior to DNA extraction .
PMA dye is cell membrane - impermeable and selectively binds to / modifies DNA from cells with damaged cell membranes ; consequently , only DNA from intact cells was amenable to PCR amplification later [38] .
Briefly , 1.25 μ l of 20 mmol / L PMA ( Cambridge Biosciences , UK ) was added to the plaque suspensions , which were incubated in the dark with occasional agitation ( 5 min ) and then placed on ice under a 500 W halogen lamp for 3 min , with occasional agitation .
DNA was extracted from the samples using the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA kit ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) , following the protocol for Gram positive bacteria .
At 14 d of growth , colonies were harvested from half of the surface of culture plates derived from 102 - and 105 - dilutions of samples SP 9 and SP 10 , and suspended in 2 ml PBS .
500 μ l of each suspension was PMA - treated and DNA was extracted as described above .
An approximately 500 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene ( covering V 1 - V 3 ) was PCR - amplified from extracted DNA samples using composite fusion primers comprising universal 16 S primers ( 27FYM and 519R ) along with Roche GS - FLX Titanium Series adapter sequences ( A & B ) for 454 pyrosequencing using the Lib - L emPCR method .
Previously described unique 12 base error - correcting Golay barcode sequences [39] were incorporated into the forward primers ( 5 ′ - CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGACTCAG - NNNNN NNNNNNN - AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG - 3 ′ ) .
The appropriate barcoded A - 27FYM and the B - 519R ( 5 ′ - CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTCTCAG - GWATT ACCGCGGCKGCTG - 3 ′ ) primers were used in PCRs with Extensor Hi - Fidelity PCR Mastermix ( Thermo Scientific ) .
There was an initial denaturation step of 5 mins at 95 ° C followed by 25 cycles of 95 ° C for 45 s , 53 ° C for 45 s , 72 ° C for 1 m 30 s and a final extension of 72 ° C for 15 mins .
PCR amplicons were subsequently purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer ' s instructions .
The size and purity of the amplicons was checked using the Agilent DNA 1000 kit and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer .
The amplicons were quantitated by means of a fluorometric assay using the Quant - iT Picogreen fluorescent nucleic acid stain ( Invitrogen ) and then pooled at equimolar concentrations ( 1 × 109 molecules / μ l ) .
emPCR and undirectional sequencing of the libraries was performed using the Lib - L kit and Roche 454 GS - FLX Plus Titanium chemistry by the the Department of Biochemistry , University of Cambridge , UK .
The mothur pipeline [40] was used for denoising , trimming , alignment to the Silva reference alignment and removal of chimerae .
Sequences were identified using the classify.seqs command .
Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences for the novel taxa detected in this study have been submitted to the DDBJ / EMBL / GenBank databases under the following accession numbers : Bacteroidetes bacterium HOT - 365 SP 18 _ 29 , KT 861603 ; Chloroflexi taxon Anaerolineae bacterium HOT - 439 SP 9 _ 5 , KT 861598 ; Chloroflexi taxon Anaerolineae bacterium HOT - 439 SP 10 _ 2 , KT 861597 ; Chloroflexi taxon Anaerolineae bacterium HOT - 439 SP 19 _ 9 , KT 861599 .
The number of people infected with Sabin polioviruses is primarily determined by the number of doses of OPV administered during routine and supplementary immunisation activities and the level of population immunity .
As the amount of OPV administered increases from zero , the number of Sabin - infected individuals will initially increase , but at some point further increases in OPV administration are likely to result in a decrease in the number of individuals infected because of the associated increase in the level of population immunity .
This implies a trade - off in the levels of OPV use that will favour VDPV emergence .
We developed two mathematical models to study this trade - off : an analytical model that includes only SIAs , and a more complex model that includes both routine immunisation and SIAs , which must be solved through numerical simulation .
We used these models to investigate the risks and benefits of carrying out preventive campaigns with tOPV as a strategy to maximise population immunity to serotype 2 prior to OPV 2 withdrawal .
We assume that a proportion of the population s0 is susceptible at the time that SIAs commence .
We also assume that the SIAs occur at least 4 weeks apart but in sufficiently close succession such that we can ignore births and deaths during the period of analysis .
Under these assumptions the expected proportion of children shedding vaccine poliovirus after a single SIA i1 can be written i1 = y11 + y21 ( 1 ) where y11 is the proportion shedding as a result of direct administration of OPV during the SIA and y21 the proportion shedding as a result of secondary spread of OPV from that SIA ( i.e. y11 and y21 differ on the source from which the infection is acquired , the vaccine or a Sabin - infected individual ) .
We denote the coverage of the campaign by v , vaccine “ take ” by w , and the basic reproduction number of Sabin polioviruses by R 0S .
We assume all individuals who shed poliovirus following vaccine “ take ” are subsequently immune to reinfection and do not thereafter participate in poliovirus transmission .
The expected proportion of children shedding following direct administration of OPV is then given by y11 = s0vw ( 2 ) assuming in this simple model that immunised individuals cannot be reinfected with OPV .
The expected proportion of children who subsequently shed as a result of secondary transmission of OPV under a simple SIR model satisfies formtok following Bailey 1975 [17] , where s0 − y11 is the proportion of children susceptible to infection .
Note that secondary spread of OPV includes second , third and subsequent generation spread , and not only transmission from a vaccinated individual .
Following this SIA , the proportion of the population that is susceptible is reduced by i1 such that the fraction susceptible becomes s1 = s0 − i1 .
We assume that all secondary transmission has finished before the next SIA .
This is a reasonable assumption if R 0S < 1 because the majority of secondary transmission will take place in under 4 weeks ( Section A .1.1 in S1 Text ) .
Subsequent SIAs are assumed to reach the same proportion v of the population ( i.e. same coverage ) , which may either consist of randomly chosen individuals at each round ( random coverage ) or repeatedly reach the same fixed group of individuals ( fixed coverage ) , meaning there is a persistently “ missed ” group .
Each of the subsequent n SIAs will result in the proportions i2 , i3 , … , in of individuals shedding Sabin poliovirus , and s2 , s3 , … , sn susceptible ( see Section A .1.2 in S1 Text for modelling details under the two types of SIA coverage , random and fixed ) .
The number r of emergent VDPVs following the n SIAs can be considered a function of the number of individuals infected with Sabin poliovirus .
The probability of Sabin reversion to VDPV may differ by whether the infection is primary or secondarily transmitted .
In the simplest case , we assume all Sabin infections have the same , very small probability of reverting to a VDPV .
In this case , the number of emergent VDPVs is given by formtok where N is the total population size and ρ is an unknown parameter that determines the absolute risk of VDPV emergence ( i.e. reversion of a Sabin virus ) .
The latter is assumed to capture unknown risk factors such as the prevalence of other enterovirus serotypes that could act as partners for recombination and the prevalence of primary immunodeficiencies that might result in prolonged excretion of vaccine poliovirus .
Because the number of emergent VDPVs depends on ρ and N via their product , we can reparameterize r by introducing the parameter σ = ρ N : formtok
The probability that an emergent VDPV spreads and produces one or more AFP cases will depend on the size of the resulting outbreak .
The cVDPVs characterised so far appear to show similar attack rates to wild poliovirus [8,12] and are therefore likely to have a reproduction number R 0V sufficient to result in a significant outbreak unless population immunity levels are high .
The probability of an outbreak of VDPV for a simple epidemic model is given by q = max ( 1 − 1 / ( R 0Vs ) , 0 ) , where s is the proportion of the population susceptible to infection .
For a major outbreak , the duration of transmission will significantly exceed 4 weeks ( unlike Sabin virus ) and therefore we make the assumption that s ≈ sn , i.e. population susceptibility is defined at the end of all n SIAs .
Assuming the overall risk of emergence is relatively small , this means that the number of emergent VDPVs that will produce an outbreak will be approximately Poisson distributed with mean proportional to rq .
The probability of ( at least ) one outbreak of VDPV occurring is therefore given by P ( VDPV outbreak ) = 1 − exp ( − rq ) ( 6 ) and the expected proportion of individuals that have been infected with a VDPV once the outbreak has finished can be obtained using the equation for y21 and replacing R 0S by R 0V , s0 − y11 by sn and y11 by ρ ∑ k = 1nik .
Fig A in S1 Text illustrates the processes captured by this model .
We use this model to explore how the probability of a VDPV outbreak changes for different number of SIAs and different SIA coverage in a scenario without routine immunisation .
The model of Sabin virus spread during the n SIAs described above can be reformulated ( Section A .2.1 in S1 Text ) and using this equivalent version , some system ’ s properties can be studied analytically , leading to a more general understanding of the model ’ s behaviour .
Very briefly , we show that multiple rounds of SIAs with the same coverage v are equivalent ( in terms of the proportion of individuals infected with Sabin at some point and the proportion who remains susceptible after the SIAs ) to a single round of SIA with vaccine coverage given as a certain function of v , w and n .
For interested readers , the equivalent version of the model and the analytical results that can be obtained are given in Section A .2 in S1 Text .
Stochastic compartmental model : routine immunisation and SIAs : We wish to study the risk of VDPV emergence and spread in the context of OPV withdrawal .
It is thus necessary to extend our previous conceptual framework to include routine immunisation .
In order to include both routine and supplementary immunisation , we constructed a stochastic compartmental model of Sabin virus and VDPV spread that also considers births and deaths .
If a fixed proportion of individuals vri is reached by routine immunisation at each scheduled dose , and three doses of OPV are given , then assuming that only a fraction w of those doses will “ take ” , the proportion c of children who received the three doses and shed Sabin virus is c = vriw ( 1 + ( 1 − w ) + ( 1 − w ) 2 ) .
We model secondary spread of OPV through an SIR model with demography where the proportion c of children vaccinated and shedding the virus enter the model as infected with Sabin poliovirus , and the other children enter the model as susceptible .
As before , a small proportion ρ of incident Sabin poliovirus infections are assumed to revert to VDPV , which may then spread in the population .
In this simple case , we assume that this proportion is fixed and independent of whether infection was acquired directly through immunisation or through secondary spread of OPV .
See Section A .3 in S1 Text for the full model description .
As for the analytical model above , two versions of the stochastic model were implemented : one where each SIA reaches a fixed proportion of the population consisting of randomly chosen individuals at each round ( random coverage , Table A in S1 Text ) , and one where the same individuals are reached at each SIA , thus leaving a persistently “ missed ” group ( fixed coverage , Table B in S1 Text ) .
We used the model to explore how the risk of VDPV 2 emergence and spread varies depending on tOPV use in a context of OPV 2 withdrawal and considering a population of 10,000 individuals .
We simulated the model from a VDPV 2 - free initial equilibrium for 1 year under different scenarios that included different levels of routine immunisation coverage and between 0 and 5 SIAs ( Fig 1 ) .
Routine immunisation with tOPV was assumed to stop at 6 months and the last tOPV SIA 4 weeks before this date corresponding to plans for SIAs with tOPV before OPV 2 withdrawal .
We defined the risk of a VDPV 2 outbreak after OPV 2 withdrawal as the probability of having > 200 incident VDPV 2 infections during the 6 months following OPV 2 withdrawal ( robustness of this threshold for increasing population size is explored , Fig F in S1 Text ) .
This corresponds to a probability of approximately 20 % of observing a case of poliomyelitis , given a case - to - infection ratio for serotype 2 of approximately 1 : 800 ( based on data indicating 4 - 5 times lower pathogenicity for this serotype compared with serotype 1 [18] , which has a case - to - infection ratio of about 1 : 150 [19,20] ) .
We performed 500 simulations for each scenario and present the proportion of simulations that resulted in this outcome .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005728.g001 Illustration of results from the stochastic dynamic mathematical model of VDPV 2 emergence and spread .
The model is simulated for 1 year and a population of 10,000 individuals , starting from a VDPV - free equilibrium that includes routine immunisation .
OPV 2 withdrawal occurs at 6 months ( red arrow ) and the last tOPV SIA is assumed to occur 4 weeks before this date in agreement with current plans .
SIAs are implemented 4 weeks apart .
We define the risk of a VDPV 2 outbreak after OPV 2 withdrawal as the probability of having > 200 incident VDPV 2 infections during the 6 months following OPV 2 cessation .
In this illustration , the grey lines represent the number of VDPV infected individuals over time for 20 different simulations of the model assuming 20 % routine immunisation coverage and 3 tOPV SIAs with 80 % coverage implemented before OPV 2 withdrawal .
For both models ( the SIA - analytical and the stochastic dynamic ) , the probability of vaccine “ take ” was set at w = 0.55 [21] and the reproduction number of Sabin virus was assumed to be < 1 and fixed to R 0S = 0.5 .
The reproduction number of VDPVs was set at R 0V = 5 , similar to estimated values for wild poliovirus [22] .
Finally , the probability of Sabin virus reversion to VDPVs was set at ρ = 5 × 10 − 4 , although we explored sensitivity of our results to this value .
Risk factors for VDPV 2 emergence and spread in Nigeria ( 2004 − 2014 ) : Multiple emergences of VDPV 2 were identified in Nigeria during 2004 − 2014 on the basis of detection of virus in stool collected from children with AFP and phylogenetic analysis of the P1 / capsid region [15,23] .
We recorded the district of residence and date of onset of paralysis for the first case of AFP associated with each of these independent emergences .
We created a database for all the districts of Nigeria for the period 2004 − 2014 that included variables describing routine immunisation coverage , serotype - 2 population immunity , the number of tOPV SIAs in the preceding 6 months ( since VDPV 2 emergence will precede detection in a child with AFP by about this time period , based on observed genetic divergence from the Sabin virus [23,24] ) , and demographic variables including mean household size , population density and annual number of births ( Section B in S1 Text ) .
We compiled the data for 6 - month periods , defined as April - September and October - March ( roughly corresponding with a high - transmission period during spring - summer months and a low - transmission period in autumn - winter months ) .
This resulted in 772x 19 = 14,668 district 6 - month observations ( from April 2004 to September 2014 ) .
Serotype - 2 population immunity was estimated among children 0 - 2 years old based on the vaccination histories of children with non - polio AFP and the SIA calendar ( Section C in S1 Text ) .
Routine immunisation coverage was estimated interpolating data across the whole country for three doses of diphtheria - tetanus - pertussis ( DTP 3 ) vaccination from the Demographic and Health Surveys ( DHS ) [25] clusters ( Section D in S1 Text ) .
We used a “ case - control ” approach to compare districts in a given 6 - month period where VDPV 2 emergences occurred with districts in a given 6 - month period where there were no VDPV 2 emergences .
In this framework , a “ case ” was defined as a district over a 6 - month period ( district − 6 - months ) where the first AFP case associated with a VDPV 2 emergence was detected .
A “ control ” was defined as a district − 6 - months with no VDPV 2 emergences .
Each district − 6 - months case was matched to 20 district − 6 - months controls from the same 6 - month period to allow for potential confounding as a result of secular trends .
The controls were randomly selected among all the district − 6 - months candidates that satisfied the matching criteria ( i.e. same 6 - month period ) .
We performed univariable and multivariable analyses using conditional logistic regression models .
Odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for all explanatory variables and associations with P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant .
All variables with Wald test P < 0.05 in univariable analyses were included in the multivariable models and the final multivariable model was the one with the lowest AIC [26] .
All the analyses were performed using the “ survival ” package [27] from R [28] .
Finally , we also used univariable logistic regression analyses to test whether any of the variables were associated with the probability that a VDPV 2 emergence resulted in > 1 case of poliomyelitis ( i.e. established a circulating lineage ) , thus corresponding to the definition of cVDPV used until July 2015 , which required that genetically linked VDPVs were isolated from at least two AFP cases .
Bacterial strains and media .
All V. harveyi strains used in this study were derived from the wild - type strain BB 120 [43] and grown aerobically at 30 ° C in Autoinducer Bioassay ( AB ) broth .
E . coli S17 - 1 λ pir was used for general DNA manipulation and grown with aeration at 37 ° C in LB ( Luria - Bertani ) broth .
The relevant strains and plasmids are listed in Table S1 .
DNA manipulations .
DNA manipulation was performed using standard procedures [44] .
Phusion DNA polymerase was used for PCR reactions .
dNTPs , restriction enzymes , and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs .
DNA purification kits were provided by Qiagen .
E . coli was transformed by electroporation using a Bio - Rad Micro Pulser .
Plasmids were introduced into V. harveyi by conjugation [15] and exconjugants were selected using the antibiotic resistances carried on the plasmids together with polymyxin B .
Fluorescent protein reporter construction .
A cat - resistance cassette from pKD 3 [45] was cloned into vector pCMW 1 [7] downstream of gfp at the BamH 1 site , making pTL 3 .
The GFP - Cmr fragment from this construct was subsequently amplified by PCR and recombined using the λ red technique [45] into a cosmid to replace the wild - type qrr 4 gene , producing pTL 20 .
Lastly , PQrr 4 - GFP - Cmr was introduced onto the chromosome to replace qrr 4 by allelic recombination .
Ptac - mCherry was amplified from the vector pEVS 143 - mCherry containing an IPTG inducible mCherry gene and cloned into pKD 13 [45] at the NheI site , resulting in pTL 82 .
The cosmid , pTL 83 , was constructed using the λ red technique by recombining the Ptac - mCherry - Kanr fragment into the intergenic region downstream of the entire lux operon .
Final insertion of Ptac - mCherry - Kanr onto the V. harveyi chromosome was accomplished by allelic recombination .
V. harveyi strain construction .
To construct the various V. harveyi sensor mutants , pKM 780 carrying Δ luxS : : Cmr , pJMH 291 carrying Δ luxN : : Cmr , pDLS 100 carrying Δ luxPQ : : Cmr , pJMH 244 carrying Δ cqsS : : Cmr , and pKM 705 carrying Δ luxR : : Kanr were used to sequentially delete the corresponding wild - type genes by allelic recombination .
Following each gene deletion , the plasmid pTL 18 containing an IPTG - inducible FLP recombinase , derived from pEVS 143 and pCP 20 [45] , was introduced into the V. harveyi strain to eliminate the antibiotic resistance marker on the chromosome .
Fluorescence assays .
For dose - response experiments , V. harveyi strains LuxN + ( TL 87 ) , LuxPQ + ( TL 88 ) , and LuxN + LuxPQ + ( TL 89 ) were grown in AB medium for 8 ∼ 12 h .
Growth was monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm .
Cultures were diluted to OD 600 = 10 − 6 ∼ 10 − 7 , and exogenous autoinducers were added at the specified concentrations .
Following growth to steady state ( 13 ∼ 14 h ; OD 600 = 0.005 ∼ 0.05 ) , cells were concentrated by centrifugation and maintained on ice until measurements were made .
One μ l of cell culture was spread on a glass slide and covered with a 1 % AB agarose pad as well as a coverslip .
Microscopy .
Phase - contrast and fluorescent images were taken at room temperature using a Nikon TE - 2000U inverted microscope .
Custom Basic code was written to control the microscope .
Images were acquired using a 100 × oil objective and a cooled CCD camera ( − 65 ° C , Andor iXon ) .
Segmentation of individual cells was performed on phase - contrast images .
Background and cellular auto - fluorescence values were subtracted from the green and red channels , respectively .
Total fluorescence intensity of each cell was obtained by summing all pixels and fractions of pixels in the segmented cell region .
Normalized GFP values for each cell were calculated by normalizing total green to total red fluorescence intensity .
Eight males and 18 females ( 20 - 40 years of age , mean age = 28.3 ± 6.3 years ) participated in the experiment .
All participants reported normal or corrected - to - normal vision and none of them had any motor or sensory abnormalities .
They gave written informed consent to participate in the study , which was approved by the NTT Communication Science Laboratories Research Ethics Committee .
All participants were right - handed .
This experiment consisted of two phases : a color - action association learning phase ( practice phase ) and a test phase .
Considering the aim of this study , we excluded the following participants from the analyses : 1 ) Those who ( two participants ) noticed the existence of the prime stimulus during the experiment due to violation of the instructions .
For example , they were fixating not the fixation point but prime - mask stimuli themselves .
2 ) Those who ( three participants ) showed no ( or little ) effect of implicitly driven motor behavior ( by invisible prime ) on action evaluation in the practice phase .
As for the latter exclusion case , since we wanted to examine what information ( online sensorimotor information , endpoint error , or an external cue ) is the more critical clue for the action evaluation in the test phase , we needed an association between color and action in the practice phase , which means a higher score in the congruent - green condition and a lower one in the incongruent - blue condition ( see Procedure and Result sections for details ) .
In the test phase , we divided the participants into two groups : an incongruent - green group ( three males and eight females , mean age = 28.3 ± 6.7 years ) and congruent - blue group ( three males and seven females , mean age = 27.6 ± 6.9 years ) as described below in detail .
Participants viewed the CRT display ( 60 Hz ) from a distance of approximately 42 cm , with their head movement restricted by a chin - rest ( see Fig . 1A ) .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0034985.g001 Experimental setup and protocol .
( A ) Configuration of the experimental apparatus .
Participants rested their heads on the chin rest and were required to make reaching movements from the button switch to the target displayed on the monitor while they watched the fixation point .
The motion of the reflective marker was recorded by the motion capture system as the kinematics of the reaching movement .
( B ) Visual stimulus layout .
The diameter of the fixation point participants were asked to watch during the trials was 0.85 deg ( shown as a green filled circle ) .
Right - or left - pointing prime and mask stimuli were regular triangles whose sides were 1.5 and 6.0 deg , respectively .
The centroid of the prime triangle was located at 10 deg above the fixation point in the vertical plane .
Possible targets ( white filled circle , diameter of 0.6 deg ) were located at 6.8 and 9.3 deg horizontally from the centroid on each side , respectively .
( C ) Time sequence of the visual stimuli ( prime - mask combination ) in each condition .
While the fixation point remained green in the congruent ( incongruent ) - green and neutral conditions after the button release , the color of the fixation point was switched from green to blue in the incongruent ( congruent ) - blue conditions at the same timing of prime onset .
The outer contour of the prime stimuli fit exactly within the inner contour of the cutout of the mask triangles .
Except for trials in the neutral condition , either the right - or left - target point ( white filled circle , diameter : 0.6 deg ) reappeared according to the direction of the mask stimulus , and feedback about the reaching endpoint ( green filled circle , diameter : 0.6 deg ) was also provided after the reaching movement ( i.e. , contact with touch panel ) .
Right - or left - pointing prime and mask stimuli were regular triangles whose sides were 1.5 and 6.0 degrees , respectively .
The centroid of the prime triangle was located at 10 deg above the fixation point in the vertical plane .
The outer contour of the prime stimuli fit exactly within the inner contour of the cutout of the mask triangles .
A neutral mask was formed from the superimposition of the two triangles ( see Figs . 1B and 1C ) .
The prime triangle was presented 100 ms after a button had been released at the start position .
It was presented for 17 ms .
The prime - mask stimulus - onset asynchrony ( SOA ) was set at 50 ms and mask presentation was 17 ms ( see Fig . 1C ) .
Right and left target points were simultaneously presented with the mask stimulus in each near or far condition ( near : 6.8 deg , far : 9.3 deg from the center of the cutout , see Fig . 1B ) .
The mask stimulus was also a cue stimulus for reaching direction .
The reaching end position was recorded with a touch panel ( Keytec . Inc ) .
The right - hand position ( monitored by a reflective marker placed on the back of the hand around the bottom of the ring finger ) was recorded with a three - dimensional motion capture system ( ProReflex , Qualisys , Sweden ) at a frequency of 250 Hz .
Before a reaching task , we needed to obtain the perceptual threshold of prime stimulus intensity so that participants would not be able to recognize the prime triangle in the main experiment .
For this purpose , we had participants perform a prime identification task using a Bayesian adaptive psychometric procedure , QUEST [34] .
Participants were requested to report the direction of the prime triangle in the two - alternative choice manner for prime ( right , left ) and mask ( right , left ) combinations randomly selected ( 80 trials ) .
QUEST is a procedure for running each trial at whatever signal strength would contribute most to minimizing the variance of the final threshold estimate ( see also [35] ) .
Such a procedure combines the experimenter ' s prior knowledge ( tGuess = − 1 , tGuessSd = 5.0 , beta = 3.5 , delta = 0.01 , gamma = 0.5 in QUEST software of Psychophysics Toolbox [36] ) and the observer ' s responses ( i.e. , right or left ) in past trials in choosing the signal strength for the next trial , and , in the end , estimating threshold .
After each response , a Gaussian probability density function is updated by Bayes ’ rule .
Each trial is placed at the current maximum - likelihood estimate of the threshold .
The threshold of each participant was set at 51 % , which is rather conservative compared to the threshold generally assigned ( i.e. , about 70 % ) .
We confirmed that the final threshold estimates appropriately converged .
With this setting , we assumed that the performance level of each participant would be almost chance level .
After this task , we also confirmed , from participants ’ reports ( cf . [37] ) , that participants could not identify the direction of the prime stimulus at all .
Next , participants performed the reaching task using the backward masking paradigm in a darkened room .
As shown in Figs . 1A and 1B , the participants were asked to place their heads on a chin - rest and to fixate a green fixation point ( diameter of 0.85 deg ) .
Each trial started by participants ’ pressing a button placed at the start position with the index finger .
The initial reaching target ( white dot , diameter of 0.6 deg ) was presented 10 deg above the fixation point for 500 ms from the start time of the button press , and participants were instructed to intend to reach for this initial target .
After the target point disappeared , two beeps at intervals of 200 ms were provided .
Participants were required to start moving ( i.e. , release the button ) at the second “ go ” beep and reach for the target point .
When a neutral mask stimulus was presented , the participants were required to reach for the initial target corresponding to the center of the cutout .
The participants had to correct their reaching movements according to the direction of the mask triangle and reach for the point consistent with the mask direction out of the two presented target points when a right - or left - pointed triangle mask was presented ( the mask stimulus was thus also a cue stimulus for reaching direction as mentioned above ) .
After the reaching movements , the target point and reaching endpoint were shown in white and green , respectively , except in the neutral condition .
There was no feedback error information when the neutral condition was applied .
The participants were instructed not to shift their gaze to the triangle ( mask ) stimulus or the target point but to keep watching the fixation point during the trial .
After each trial , except those in the neutral condition , the participants were requested to answer the following two questions : Did the fixation point color remain green or did it switch from green to blue ( the color identification task ) ?
To what extent did you appropriately perform the movement according to your intention of reaching for the target based on the stimulus ( mask ) direction ?
The second question was reported on a 5 - point scale ( i.e. , 5 - very smooth ; 1 - very clumsy ) .
The reaching task consisted of two phases : a color - action association learning phase ( practice phase ) and a test phase .
In the practice and test phases , 384 and 192 trials were completed , respectively .
A short break was inserted every 48 trials .
In the practice phase , there were three conditions as shown in Fig . 1C : 1 ) congruent - green ( 50 % ) , in which the prime direction was congruent with the mask one [ prime - mask combinations of right - right ( RR ) and left - left ( LL ) ] and the color of fixation point remained green ; 2 ) incongruent - blue ( 33 % ) , in which the prime direction was incongruent with the mask one [ prime - mask combinations : right - left ( RL ) condition and left - right ( LR ) ] and the color of fixation point was switched to blue ; 3 ) neutral ( 17 % ) , in which neutral mask triangle without the prime was presented and the color of the fixation point remained green .
In the test phase , an additional color - stimuli combination condition , either incongruent - green or congruent - blue , was inserted in addition to the congruent - green , incongruent - blue , and neutral conditions ( see Fig . 1C ) .
The rate of each condition was as follows .
Congruent - green condition 50 % , incongruent - blue condition 25 % , incongruent - green or congruent - blue condition 8 % , and neutral condition 17 % .
Trial order was pseudo randomized in both phases .
The participant group in the practice phase was divided into two groups in the test phase : an incongruent - green group , in which the incongruent - green condition was inserted , and a congruent - blue group , in which the congruent - blue condition was inserted .
The hand position data were temporally aligned with respect to the button release and were filtered offline using a fourth - order Butterworth filter ( double - sided ) with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz .
The velocity was calculated from three - point numerical time differentiations of the filtered position data .
Our main interest is the effect of the prime direction on motor behavior , so we analyzed the following data pooled from both target positions ( i.e. , near and far conditions ) .
To quantify the effect of the prime stimulus on motor behavior , we calculated the mean velocity of a 100 - ms - time window from 200 to 300 ms after prime onset in each condition .
We adopted the mean X - velocity as the index of the prime effect because velocity is more suitable for detecting the transient behavioral changes than position ( trajectory ) .
The response onset to the prime stimulus was defined as the time from which the velocity differences between RR ( LL ) and LR ( RL ) continuously exceeded a threshold value of 30 mm / s for at least 40 ms in a window between 150 and 300 ms after the prime onset .
The threshold value approximately corresponded to 2 SDs of the velocity during a period of 0 - 50 ms after the button release ( cf . [38] ) .
Endpoint error was calculated as the Euclidean ( linear ) distance in two - dimensional space ( on the vertical plane ) between the endpoint of the reaching movement recorded with the touch panel and the target position ( see Figs . 1A and 1C ) .
Mean endpoint error in each condition was averaged by the sum of each trial ’ s endpoint error in each condition .
Repeated measures ANOVAs were applied to these mean values .
Specifically , the prime direction ( right , left ) and mask one ( right , left ) were within - participant factors for velocity , and mask direction ( right , left ) and conditions [ congruent - green , incongruent - blue ] were within - participant factors for the endpoint error and action evaluation score in the practice phase .
In the test phase , the prime direction ( right , left ) and condition [ congruent - green , incongruent - blue , incongruent - green ( or congruent - blue ) ] were within - participant factors for the velocity , and the mask direction ( right , left ) and conditions [ congruent - green , incongruent - blue , incongruent - green ( or congruent - blue ) ] were within - participant factors for the endpoint error .
Tukey ' s HSD procedure was used for post - hoc comparison of means ( alpha level = .05 ) .
As for the action evaluation score , we are interested in whether the action evaluation is modulated by the color cue itself , so we performed planned t tests on the mean evaluation scores for incongruent - blue and incongruent - green conditions in the incongruent - green group and on those for congruent - green and congruent - blue conditions in the congruent - blue group .
Finally , to identify the information used in the action evaluation , we introduced path analyses .
We have the assumption that online corrections induced by the invisible prime stimulus and / or consequent endpoint error are potential candidates that could affect the action evaluation in the practice phase .
In the test phase , the color cue would inferentially contribute to the evaluation of one ’ s own action .
The color cue variable introduced in the test phase was nominal scale , so we used a dummy variable for the analysis ; that is , blue was transformed to 0 and green was transformed to 1 .
For each variable , we calculated the variance inflation factor ( VIF ) , which , as suggested by Myers [39] , should be less than 10 to avoid multicollinearity problems .
We focused on the standardized path coefficients between variables .
Standardized path coefficients indicate the relative effect of variables within the model .
A higher wood - feeding termite species , N . arborum ( Smeathman ) was used in this study .
The genus Nasutitermes Dudley , 1890 is a key taxon widespread in all tropical areas , with 243 species currently described .
Nasutitermes species are wood - feeding termites and their post - embryonic development has been well established .
A nest of N . arborum ( Termitidae , Nasutitermitinae ) was collected in the Republic of the Congo ( Brazzaville ) , in the Mayombe forest within UNESCO - Man and the Biosphere Reserve , in the district of Mvouti ( 4 ° 14 ’ S , 12 ° 26 ’ E ) , with the permission of Dieudonne MBOUMBA , the Administrative Head of the district of Mvouti ( Congo ) .
This field study did not involve endangered or protected species .
The nest was kept in a termitarium at the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement ( IRD ) in Pointe Noire ( Congo ) .
Termites were identified on the basis of morphological criteria and in comparison with laboratory collections by Dr Alain Robert , entomologist and termite expert .
The nest was partially broken to collect the eggs , larvae and adult workers .
The two larval instars were distinguished using the standard morphometric criteria for the Nasutitermes genus [10,11] .
Triplicate samples of 50 eggs , 30 individuals of each larval stage and 25 workers were used .
The eggs were surface - sterilized by dipping them twice in 70 % ethanol for 1 min , followed by five rinses in sterile water .
The whole gut of termite larvae and workers was removed aseptically using fine sterile forceps under a bacteriological hood and pooled for each replicate in 1.5 ml sterile microtubes .
Guts and eggs were first crushed using a polypropylene micro pestle in 1.5 ml microtubes .
The DNA was then extracted using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit ( QIAGEN , QIAGEN GmbH , D .40724 Hilden , Germany ) in accordance with manufacturer ’ s instructions .
The final DNA concentration was determined by electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel , with a quantitative DNA ladder ( High DNA Mass Ladder , Invitrogen , 5791 Van Allen Way Carlbad , CA 92008 ) for comparison .
Prior to pyrosequencing analyses , the DNA concentration of the samples was quantified photometrically using a ND - 1000 Spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop products , Wilmington , USA ) .
Pyrosequencing and processing of 16S rRNA gene sequence : The purified DNA from the triplicates was pooled for pyrosequencing .
Aliquots with similar DNA concentrations were sent to the Research and Testing Laboratory ( Lubbock , TX , USA ) for sequencing .
A DNA fragment spanning the V 1 - V 3 variable regions of the 16S rRNA genes was amplified using the eubacterial primers 28F and 519R and pyrosequenced using a Roche 454 FLX pyrosequencer .
The resulting sequences were analyzed using Mothur v. 1.33.3 [12] .
Pyrosequencing reads were processed using the method described by Schloss [13] .
Sequencing error was reduced using an implementation of the AmpliconNoise algorithm and low - quality sequences were removed ( minimum length 200 bp , allowing 1 mismatch to the barcode , 2 mismatches to the primer , and homopolymers no longer than 8 bp ) .
Sequences were then trimmed to keep only high quality reads ( Q ≥ 35 ) .
Chimeras were removed using the chimera.uchime mothur command .
Singletons were included in the analysis .
Sequences were aligned and classified according to the SILVA bacterial SSU reference database v. 102 [14] .
They were then assigned to genus - level phylotypes using the naive Bayes classifier implemented in Mothur and clustered into operational taxonomic units ( OTU ) using the average neighbor algorithm and a sequence identity cutoff of 97 % .
The Greengenes database [15] , and the DictDb reference database v. 2.3 [6] were used for the taxonomic assignment of OTUs .
The shared OTUs ( 97 % sequence identity ) between life stages ( eggs , L2 larvae and workers ) were determined using the Venn diagram package implemented in Mothur .
The Venny 2.0.2 software was used to plot resulting data .
Relative abundance of each group of OTUs was added manually .
Sequences are available in NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioSample accession ID SAMN 03114856 and SAMN 03114878 to SAMN 03114880 associated with BioProjects PRJNA 270400 - PRJNA 270403 .
In each pyrotag library , the relative abundance of an OTU is the percentage of reads included in this OTU with respect to the total number of reads .
The relative abundance of each taxon in a given sample is the sum of abundances of all the OTUs included .
Clone libraries and phylogenetic analysis : The near - full - length 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the 27F / 1390R primers [16] .
PCR reactions were performed in 25 μ L reaction mixtures containing 15.2 μ l Taq polymerase Master Mix ( Qiagen ) , 0.25 μ M of each primer and 50 ng of template DNA as described by Thongaram et al [16] using a Prime Elite thermal cycler ( TECHNE ™ , Bibby Scientific Limited , Staffordshire , UK ) .
Amplicons were gel - purified using the GFX ™ Purification Kit ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) and cloned into the pCR 4 - TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit ( Invitrogen ) , following the manufacturer ’ s instructions .
White clones were screened for the presence of the expected insert by PCR amplification using the vector - specific primers M13F - 20 / M13 - 26R .
For each sample , 70 positive clones were double - sequenced at Beckman Coulter Genomics ( Takeley , CM 22 6TA Essex United Kingdom ) .
The sequences were quality checked and processed in the same way as for pyrotag sequences .
A phylogenetic analysis was performed using OTUs classified within the most representative phylum ( Spirochaetes ) .
A nucleotide Blast search was run and the five closest sequences imported for each OTU .
Other Spirochaetes 16S rRNA gene sequences were randomly imported .
The redundant sequences were removed and the sequences were aligned using SILVA SINA ( www.arb-silva.de/aligner/ ) with the reference dataset SILVA SSU Ref NR [17] .
The alignment was improved manually by removing conserved gaps and ambiguously aligned regions .
The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the Maximum Likelihood method implemented in MEGA v 6.0 [18] and the Tamura - Nei model with 1000 bootstraps .
All experimental procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the EU Directive 2010 / 63 / UE and the relevant national legislation , namely the French “ Decret No . 2013 - 118 , 1er fevrier 2013 , Ministere de l ’ Agriculture , de l ’ Agroalimentaire et de la Foret ” .
Protocols were approved by the ethical committee of the Museum National d ’ Histoire Naturelle ( Comite Cuvier , Licence : 68 - 002 ) and by the “ Direction departementale de la cohesion sociale et de la protection des populations ” ( DDCSPP ) ( No . C75 - 05 - 15 ) .
L . sigmodontis was maintained in our laboratory , and infective third - stage larvae ( L3 ) were recovered by dissection of the mite vector Ornithonyssus bacoti as previously described [38-40] .
Six - week - old female BALB / c mice were purchased from Harlan ( France ) and maintained in the MNHN animal facilities on a 12 - hours light / dark cycle .
Infective L3 larvae were either inoculated or transmitted through the bite of the vector mite O . bacoti ( “ natural infection ” ) .
Mice were inoculated with 40 infective L3 either subcutaneously into the left lumbar area in 200 μ l of RPMI 1640 or intravenously into the caudal vein in 50 μ l of RPMI 1640 .
For natural infections mites were left in contact with the mice for 12 h [40] .
A group of 100 infected mites from the same batch was dissected under a binocular microscope to evaluate the average number of L3 per mite .
Since it has been shown previously that no L3 remained in the blood - fed mites [40] , this allowed us to evaluate the number of L3 given per mouse .
Kinetics of infection were followed over 8 days of infection .
Mice were sacrificed at 2 hours , 6 hours , 4 days , 6 days and 8 days post - inoculation ( p.i . ) .
Pleural lavage , pleural fluid isolation , pleural exudate cells and filarial load : The mice were anesthetized then sacrificed by final bleeding .
The pleural cavity was washed 10 times with 1 ml of cold phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) to collect pleural fluid , pleural exudate cells ( PleCs ) and filariae as previously described [41] .
The first 2 ml were collected in a separate tube to limit pleural fluid dilution .
The remaining 8 ml were isolated in a second tube .
After 30 min deposition , the top 1 ml of the first tube was collected and centrifuged ( 5 min , 250g ) then the pleural fluid supernatant was frozen ( - 20 ° C ) for subsequent analyses .
The PleCs pellet was taken up in the remaining 1 ml of the first tube and pooled into the 8 ml of the second tube .
The filariae rapidly sediment at the bottom of the tube and the upper 8 ml containing the PleCs were transferred into a new tube and centrifuged ( 5 min , 250g ) .
PleCs were diluted in 1ml medium and counted .
The isolated filariae were counted , analyzed by light microscopy ( Olympus BX 63 microscope , Olympus DP 72 camera ) and measured using the cellSens Dimension 1.9 software .

The pellet was pooled in the remaining 9 ml of the lavage .
After centrifugation ( 5 min , 250 g ) , the pellet containing the BAL cells was diluted in 1ml of PBS - 2 % foetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( EUROBIO ) .
Recovery of L3 in pulmonary lobes : Naive , subcutaneously ( SC ) or intravenously ( IV ) infected mice were sacrificed by final bleeding at 2 hours , 6 hours , 4 days and 8 days post infection .
After pleural and bronchoalveolar lavages with cold PBS , lungs were cut at the left and right principal bronchus to separate each pulmonary lobe and then removed .
Right and left lung were placed separately in 5 cm Ø Petri dishes each containing 7 ml of PBS and torn up into small pieces ( about 2 - 4 mm 2 ) .

The thorax was opened and the trachea was exposed .
The lung was filled via the trachea with 2 % ( w / v in PBS , pH 7.4 ) low melting point agarose warmed to 40 ° C ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in phosphate buffered saline .
They were then removed from the thorax and transferred to ice cold PBS , then fixed 2h in cold 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS and finally stored at 4 ° C in PBS .
The left lung was isolated and was glued with the hilum facing downwards on cooled aluminium block using super glue .

Sections were washed in PBS - BSA - Triton , then PBS and post - fixed with 4 % PFA for 5 min .
After a subsequent rinsing step , the slices were transferred into a 24 - well imaging plate ( IBIDI ) , covered with buffered Mowiol 4 - 88 , pH 8.5 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) then coverslipped .

Representation and data analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software .
The dataset was sourced from the National Health Insurance Research Database ( NHIRD ) for the period from 2007 to 2009 .
Initiated in 1995 , Taiwan ’ s NHI program is characterized by a single plan with the government as the sole insurer , comprehensive benefits , low co - payments , and free choice of healthcare providers from a widely - dispersed network .
The NHI had 22.60 million members ( an over 98 % coverage rate of Taiwan ’ s 22.96 million residents ) at the end of 2009 .
The NHIRD is published annually by the Taiwan National Health Research Institute , and contains the original claim data and registration files for all the enrollees under the NHI program .
Many studies have used this dataset and have been published in international , peer - reviewed journals [10] .
This study was exempted from full review by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) of the Taipei Medical University , after consulting with the director of the Taipei Medical University IRB , because the NHIRD consists of de - identified secondary data released to the public for research purposes .
In total , 65,339 patients hospitalized with a discharge diagnosis of acute appendicitis ( International Classification of Disease , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modification ( ICD - 9 - CM ) codes 540 , 540.0 , 540.1 and 540.9 ) between January 2007 and December 2009 were selected from the NHIRD .
Of these sampled patients , we identified 22,068 patients ( 33.8 % ) who had undergone laparoscopic appendectomies , according to the ICD - 9 - CM procedure code 47.01 .
The key independent variable of interest was whether the performed appendectomy was laparoscopic or open .
The key dependent variables included the 30 - day re - admission for the treatment of acute appendicitis , the length of stay ( LOS ) , and the cost per discharge ( defined as the aggregate monetary value of all the itemized costs of all the services and disposables billed to the NHI ) .
We used the SAS package ( version 9.1 ) for statistical analysis in this study .
The Pearson χ 2 tests were used to compare the difference between patients who had undergone laparoscopic appendectomies and patients who had undergone open appendectomies , according to the following characteristics : surgeon ( age , sex , and practice location ) ; hospital ( teaching status and hospital accreditation level ) ; and patient ( age , sex and Charlson Cormobidity Index ( CCI ) score ) .
Mann - Whitney tests were carried out to examine the relationship between the LOS , the cost per discharge , and the appendectomy method .
The generalized estimated equation ( GEE ) was utilized to explore the difference in 30 - day readmission rates between laparoscopic appendectomies and open appendectomies , after accounting for any clustering of the sampled patients among particular surgeons , and adjusting for surgeon , hospital , and patient characteristics .
In addition , hierarchical linear regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the use of laparoscopy , the natural logarithm of the LOS , and the cost per discharge .
We also calculated a propensity score for each patient and adjusted for propensity in all regression models .
A propensity score was initially used to balance demographic and treatment characteristics , which were distributed unequally between patients who had undergone laparoscopic appendectomies and open appendectomies .
Because the probability of undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies depends on the opinion of both the surgeon and the patient , variables for the surgeon ’ s age , sex , and practice location , as well as the patient ’ s age , sex and CCI score , were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model as predictors , to calculate the expected probability of undergoing laparoscopic appendectomies for each patient .
A two - sided p value of less than , or equal to , 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
All fMRI data collection at Dartmouth College was approved by the Dartmouth Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects .
Resting state data from the Human Connectome Project was approved by the Institutional Review Boards associated with that project .
Movie data : Raiders of the Lost Ark : We scanned 11 healthy young right - handed participants ( 4 females ; Mean age : 24.6 + / - 3.7 years ) during movie viewing .
Participants had no history of neurological or psychiatric illness .
All had normal or corrected - to - normal vision .
Informed consent was collected in accordance with the procedures set by the local Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects .
Participants were paid for their participation .
These data also were used in a prior publication on whole cortex RHA [16] .
Stimuli consisted of the full - length feature movie - “ Raiders of the Lost Ark ” - divided into eight parts of approximately 14 to 15 min duration .
Video was projected onto a rear projection screen with an LCD projector which the subject viewed through a mirror on the head coil .
The video image subtended a visual angle of approximately 22.7 ° horizontally and 17 ° vertically .
Audio was presented through MR Confon ’ s MRI - compatible headphones .
Participants were instructed to pay attention to the movie and enjoy .
See [16] for details .
Participants were scanned in a Philips Intera Achieva 3T scanner with an 8 channel head coil at the Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center .
T1 - weighted anatomical scans were acquired at the end of each session ( MPRAGE , TR = 9.85 s , TE = 4.53 s , flip angle = 8 ° , 256 × 256 matrix , FOV = 240 mm , 160 1 mm thick sagittal slices ) .
The voxel resolution was 0.9375 mm × 0.9375 mm × 1.0 mm .
Functional scans of the whole brain were acquired with an echo planar imaging sequence ( TR = 2.5 s , TE = 35 ms , flip angle = 90 ° , 80 × 80 matrix , FOV = 240 mm × 240 mm ) every 2.5 s with whole brain coverage ( 41 3 mm thick interleaved axial slices , giving isotropic 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm voxels ) .
We acquired a total of 2718 functional scans with 1350 TRs in four runs during the first session and 1368 TRs in four runs during the second session .
fMRI movie data were preprocessed using AFNI software [42] ( http://afni.nimh.nih.gov ) .
Functional data were first corrected for the order of slice acquisition and head motion by aligning to the last volume of the last functional run .
Any spikes in the data were removed using 3dDespike in AFNI .
Data were then filtered using 3dBandpass in AFNI to remove any temporal signal variation slower than 0.00667 Hz , faster than 0.1 Hz or that correlated with the whole brain average signal or the head movement parameters .
Each subject ’ s anatomical volume was first aligned to the motion corrected average EPI volume and then to the MNI 152 brain template in AFNI .
Functional EPI BOLD data were then aligned to the MNI 152 brain template using nearest neighbor resampling by applying the transformation derived from the alignment of the anatomical volume to the template .
Data acquired during the overlapping movie segments were discarded resulting in a total of 2662 TRs with 1326 TRs in the first session and 1336 TRs in the second session .
Definition of masks and searchlights for movie data : We derived a gray matter mask by segmenting the MNI _ avg 152T 1 brain provided in AFNI and removing any voxel that was outside the cortical surface by more than twice the thickness of the gray matter at each surface node .
It included 54,034 3 mm isotropic voxels across both hemispheres .
We used this mask for all subsequent analyses of all subjects .
Hyperalignment of movie data started with hyperalignment of data in 20,484 overlapping searchlights of 20 mm radius centered on cortical nodes with 2.9 mm average spacing between the nodes .
Cortical nodes were defined in a standard cortical surface from FreeSurfer ( fsaverage ) ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu ) and resampled into a regular grid using AFNI ’ s MapIcosahedron [42,43] with 10,242 nodes in each hemisphere .
We defined the surface searchlights [44] in PyMVPA [45] ( http://www.pymvpa.org ) as cortical disks .
The thickness of disks was extended beyond the gray matter , as defined in FreeSurfer , 1.5 times inside the white - matter gray - matter boundary and 1.0 times outside the gray - matter pial surface boundary to accommodate any misalignment of gray matter as computed from the anatomical scan and the gray matter voxels in the EPI scan .
To reduce the contribution from noisy or non - gray matter voxels that were included due to this dilation , we used a between - subject correlation measure on training data [13] to select 70 % of the voxels in each searchlight [16] .
The mean number of selected voxels in movie data searchlights was 235 .
Searchlights for defining connectivity targets were defined using a coarse surface grid corresponding to the ico 8 surface in SUMA [43] with 1284 nodes ( 10.7 mm spacing between nodes ) .
We used surface disk searchlights [44] centered on these nodes as the movie data connectivity target searchlights .
These searchlights had a radius of 13 mm , as did those used for the HCP data , producing complete coverage of the cortex with overlapping searchlights .
Cortical disks centered on these voxels were dilated using the same procedure as for hyperalignment of cortical surface searchlights .
Movie connectivity target searchlights had a mean of 99 voxels .
Resting state data : Human Connectome Project : In the HCP database [20] , we found unrelated subjects of age < = 35 with at least four resting state scans , yielding a list of 64 subjects .
We chose the first 20 of these subjects in the sorted order of subject IDs for our analysis .
For each subject , we used their cortical surfaces and fMRI data aligned to the group using MSM - All [22] with 32K nodes in each hemisphere as provided by the HCP .
We used data from one resting state session [19] ( “ rfMRI _ REST 1 _ LR ” ) to derive CHA parameters and validated it on a different resting state session ( “ rfMRI _ REST 2 _ LR ” ) , and task fMRI sessions [18] ( EMOTION , GAMBLING , LANGUAGE , MOTOR , RELATIONAL , SOCIAL , and WM ) .
Resting state data were acquired for 1200 TRs with a TR of 0.720 s in each session ( total time = 14 min 33 s ) .
The data used to derive the CHA parameters and common model and the resting state data used for validation tests used the same phase - encoding direction ( LR ) .
We used a single session of rsfMRI for alignment to mimic a typical resting state data acquisition which usually varies from 10 - 20 mins of scanning .
See [19] for more details about the acquisition and preprocessing pipelines .
Definition of masks and searchlights for HCP data : We masked the data to include only the left and right cortices ( Cortex _ Left and Cortex _ Right ) , removing all the non - zero nodes that correspond to the medial subcortical regions , resulting in 59,412 nodes across both hemispheres .
These nodes also defined the centers of 59,412 surface searchlights [44] with 20 mm radii that were used for hyperalignment .
All nodes in these searchlights were included .
The mean number of surface nodes in the HCP searchlights was 337 .
We defined connectivity target searchlights using a coarser surface grid corresponding to the ico 8 surface in SUMA [43] with 1284 nodes ( 10.7 mm spacing between nodes ) .
We found the closest matching nodes on the 32K surface to the nodes on the ico 8 surface , and used those as centers for connectivity target searchlights .
These searchlights had a radius of 13 mm , producing complete coverage of the cortex with overlapping searchlights .
HCP connectivity target searchlights had a mean of 142 loci .
See further details below for how time - series were extracted from these searchlights .
For validation of task fMRI , we used all of the maps provided by the HCP after removing redundancies ( such as FACE - AVG and AVG - FACE ) , which resulted in 46 maps ( S2 Table ) .
We use CHA to derive a common model of the human connectome and the transformation matrices that project individual brains ’ connectomes into the common model connectome space .
The common model connectome is a high - dimensional information space .
In the current implementation , the model space based on movie fMRI data has 54,034 dimensions , corresponding to the number of voxels in the gray matter mask , and the model space based on HCP resting state fMRI data has 59,412 dimensions , corresponding to the number of cortical nodes in those data .
The derivation of this space starts with hyperalignment in local cortical fields , searchlights , which yields orthogonal transformation matrices for each subject in each field .
These searchlights are aligned across subjects based on anatomy ( movie data ) or MSM - All ( HCP resting state data ) ; consequently , each locus within a searchlight is similarly aligned across subjects before CHA .
Local transformation matrices for each searchlight map anatomically or MSM - All aligned cortical loci in a cortical field to CHA - aligned dimensions in the common model connectome .
These local transformation matrices are then aggregated into a whole brain transformation matrix , which is not globally orthogonal .
The whole brain transformation matrices are derived based on local hyperalignment in searchlights to constrain resampling of information to cortical neighborhoods defined by those searchlights .
The basic equation for hyperalignment ( both CHA and RHA ) : Bij are the original matrices of data for cortical fields , j , in individual brains , i , which have mij columns of cortical loci and n rows of data vectors .
Hyperalignment derives a transformation matrix for each cortical field in each individual , Rij , and a matrix for each cortical field , Mj , that is the mean of transformed individual brain matrices , BijRij , minimizing the Frobenius norm of differences between transformed individual brain matrices and the model space matrix .
For each cortical field j : formtok
For whole cortex hyperalignment we define the cortical fields , j , as searchlights .
Thus , we estimate a transformation matrix , Rij , for each of Nsl searchlights in each subject i .
We then aggregate these searchlight transformation matrices into a whole cortex transformation matrix , RiA ( details below ) : RiA = f ( Rij )
( 2 ) The whole cortex common model data matrix , M , is created by transforming individual whole cortex data matrices , BiA , into common model space coordinates and calculating the mean : formtok Conversely , other subjects ’ data in the common model space can be mapped into any subject ’ s individual anatomical space using the transpose of that subject ’ s whole cortex transformation matrix , RiAT , producing a data matrix , Mi , in which the columns are that subject ’ s cortical loci , making it possible to analyze and visualize transformed group data in any subject ’ s anatomical space : Mi = MRiAT ( 4 ) In our implementations of hyperalignment , we have used a variant of Generalized Procrustes Analysis [46,47] ( described in detail below ) to derive orthogonal transformation matrices for the improper rotations of a brain data matrix from a cortical field ( region of interest or searchlight ) to the mean of others ’ matrices for the same region to minimize interindividual differences between the transformed individual and mean data matrices .
Aggregation of searchlight transformation matrices , Rij , produces a whole cortex transformation matrix , RiA .
Because RiA is derived from searchlight transformation matrices , Rij , it imposes a locality constraint that limits remapping of brain data to nearby cortical loci ( see details below ) , making the whole cortex transformation matrix nonorthogonal by design .
We also have tested other hyperalignment algorithms that use alternatives for calculating the transformation matrices , such as regularized canonical correlation and probabilistic estimation [48,49] .
These alternatives are effective but have not yet been extended to aggregate local transformation matrices for cortical fields into a whole cortex transformation matrix .
The dimensionality of the brain and model data matrices is n × m , in which m equals the number of cortical nodes or dimensions in brain and model data matrices - Bij , BiA , Mj , and M - and n equals the number of data vectors across these dimensions .
The number of data vectors , n , is set and determined by the number of connectivity targets for defining connectivity pattern vectors ( see details below ) .
For RHA , n is set by the number of response pattern vectors in an experimental dataset .
The number of cortical loci in a cortical field or searchlight , mij , can vary across subjects .
If the number of cortical loci or dimensions differs between subjects or between an individual subject and the model space , the new subject ’ s data are transformed into a space with the same dimensionality as the first subject ’ s or the model ’ s space .
The number of cortical loci in the whole cortex model is set at m = 59,412 for HCP data and m = 54,034 for movie data .
We also have shown that the dimensionality of a model for region of interest or searchlight ( mj ) can be reduced substantially relative to the dimensionality of individual brain spaces in imaging datasets ( mij ) , mMj < < mij [13,16,48] .
In the current version of CHA , as in whole cortex RHA , however , we do not reduce the dimensionality of the model space because these reduced dimensionality local models are difficult to aggregate into a whole cortex model .
Note that the common model data matrix has two distinct components .
The columns define a common model space , whereas the rows are defined by the experimental data - either patterns of connectivity to targets elsewhere in the brain for CHA , or patterns of response for RHA .
The space can be illustrated as an anatomical space insofar as it can be rotated into any individual ’ s cortical loci ( Eq 4 ) , but there is no “ canonical ” anatomical space , rather the individuality of each individual brain is preserved .
We illustrate results in the anatomical space of one subject , the “ reference subject ” , but we also could illustrate the results in other subjects ’ anatomical spaces .
The special nature of the common space derives from the alignment of functional indices - connectivities and responses - to minimize interindividual differences and , thereby , discover shared basis functions for the individually variable functional architecture .
These basis functions are the response and connectivity profiles for model dimensions that model the response and connectivity profiles of cortical loci in individual brains as linear weighted sums .
In other words , Eq 4 models single columns in Bi as weighted sums of columns in Mi .
Transformation matrices consist only of weights for the projection of individual brain spaces for cortical fields , Bij , or the whole cortex , BiA , into model spaces ( Mj , M ) and contain no connectivity or response data .
Thus , a transformation matrix can be applied to any matrix of data vectors in an individual brain space .
Similarly , the transposes of transformation matrices , RiAT , can be applied to any data vector in the model space to project that vector into the cortical topographies of individual brains .
For all applications of the common model , including the validation tests presented here , the transformation matrices are applied to independent data that played no role in derivation of the model space and the individual transformation matrix parameters .
This is necessary to avoid overfitting [50] .
Transformation matrices derived from connectivity data also can be applied to response data and vice versa .
In other words , RHA and CHA are complementary methods for deriving a common model of information spaces in cortex , and RHA - derived and CHA - derived transformation matrices are alternative projections for mapping individual brain data into the same common model space .
Note that each column of the transformation matrix RiA contains weights for cortical loci in subject i ’ s brain .
These columns of weights are basis functions for modeling functional topographies in individual brains as linear weighted sums of topographies associated with model dimension functional profiles .
Derivation of transformation matrices for regions of interest and searchlights : The derivation of individual transformation matrices that map individual brain spaces into the common model space is a three - level iterative process .
We present the iterative algorithm for deriving transformation matrices and the common model space in greater detail here to help readers understand better its structure .
In the first step of the first level , the data matrix for a cortical field in one subject , B2j , is transformed to be in optimal alignment with the same cortical field in another subject ’ s brain , B1j , referred to here as the reference subject : formtok
We use the Procrustes transformation to find the orthogonal matrix that affords the optimal improper rotation to achieve this minimization [46] .
Note that this “ rotation ” is a rotation of data in the high - dimensional feature space , not a rotation in a two or three dimensional anatomical space .
Elsewhere we have shown that other algorithms can be used to achieve this minimization [48,49] .
In the following steps of the first level , the brain data matrices for the third and subsequent subjects are transformed to be in optimal alignment with the matrix defined by the mean of the previous subject ’ s matrix and the previous mean : formtok where formtok Mi - 1 , j ( level 1 ) is the target data used to hyperalign the current subject ’ s data , Bij , and Mi - 2 , j ( level 1 ) is the target data used to hyperalign the previous subject ’ s data , Bi - 1 , j .
Target data is updated with previous subjects ’ aligned data in this first level .
In the subsequent two levels each subject ’ s data matrix is hyperaligned to the simple , unweighted mean of all other subjects ’ matrices .
At the end of the first level , level one transformation matrices have been derived for all cortical fields in all subjects , Ri , j ( level 1 ) , which are used to project each subjects ’ brain data into the provisional common spaces that evolved over level one iterations Mi , j ( level 1 ) .
Each subject is then re - hyperaligned to the mean data matrix for all other subjects ’ transformed data from level one to derive new individual transformation matrices , Rij ( level 2 ) .
Note that the new transformation matrices are derived using each subject ’ s original brain data , Bij .
Note also that the mean matrices in provisional common spaces , M ¬ i , j ( level 1 ) , exclude data from the subject being hyperaligned : formtok where M ¬ i , j ( level 1 ) is the equally - weighted mean of level one transformed data for all subjects but subject i : formtok
After the level two transformation matrices , Rij ( level 2 ) , are calculated for each subject , the level one transformation matrices are discarded , and the group mean of transformed individual brain data matrices is recalculated , using these new transformation matrices , producing the model matrix , M : formtok
In level 3 , the last level , the final searchlight transformation matrices , Rij , are recalculated for each subject ( see Eq 1 above ) .
Derivation of whole cortex transformation matrices : Orthogonal transformation matrices for hyperaligning a cortical field can map information from a cortical locus into model dimensions anywhere else in that cortical field .
To constrain the remapping of information to nearby locations in the reference subject ’ s cortical anatomy , we developed a searchlight - based approach [16] .
We hyperalign the data in Nsl overlapping searchlights , where Nsl is the number of searchlights ( 59,412 for HCP data , 20,484 for movie data ) .
The number of model dimensions in each searchlight transformation matrix is determined in the movie data by cortical location and the number of selected features in the reference subject ( mean = 235 ) and in HCP data by the cortical location of the searchlight ( mean = 337 ) .
The transformation for each searchlight , Rij , has dimensionality that corresponds to the number of nodes in an individual ’ s searchlight ( mij rows ) and the number model dimensions in that searchlight , derived from the reference subject ’ s anatomy ( m1j rows ) .
Thus , each transformation matrix has on the order of 28K and 57K free parameters for movie data and HCP data , respectively .
Because the searchlights are overlapping , there are multiple estimates of weights for mapping each cortical locus to each model dimension .
As described in Guntupalli et al . [16] these weights are aggregated across searchlights by adding all weights for each cortical - locus - to - model - dimension mapping .
In essence , this is equivalent to creating a whole cortex transformation matrix , RiA , of dimensionality m × m , by padding each searchlight transformation matrix , Rij , with zeroes in all rows and columns for cortical loci and model dimensions that are not in the individual or model searchlight cortical field to give them the same dimensionality to produce Rij ( padded ) , and then summing these padded transformation matrices .
Thus , for each subject , i : formtok where Nsl is the number of searchlights and Rij ( padded ) is the padded transformation matrix for subject i in searchlight j with dimensionality m × m .
As noted above , m is the number of cortical loci - 59,412 surface nodes for HCP data and 54,034 voxels in the gray matter mask for movie data - and the number of whole cortex model dimensions .
Because the searchlight approach constrains cortical - locus - to - model - dimension mapping to nearby cortical locations , the whole cortex transformation matrix , RiA , is sparse with zero weights for all mappings of cortical loci to model dimensions that are separated by more than 2x the searchlight diameter ( ~ 4 cm in this implementation ) .
The whole cortex transformation matrices , RiA , are large ( m × m ) but sparse .
98.7 % of the entries are zeros , and roughly 20 million entries have nonzero values in each of these matrices .
The additive aggregation of mapping parameters weights nearby cortical location pairs , which co - occur in more searchlights than distant pairs , more strongly than distant pairs , adding a further locality constraint .
Note that the searchlight transformation matrices , Rij , are orthogonal but the whole cortex transformation matrices , RiA , are not by design , to introduce the locality constraint .
The whole cortex transformation matrices , RiA , are used in all validation tests to hyperalign independent new data matrices after normalizing the data in each cortical node or voxel .
In other words , all validation tests are performed on independent data that played no role in deriving the transformation matrix parameters or the common model connectome , providing cross - validated generalization testing .
CHA of movie data was based on one half of the movie data ( ~ 55 min , ~ 1300 TRs ) and the other , independent half of the movie data was used for validation tests with two - fold cross - validation .
CHA of HCP data was based on one session of resting state data ( ~ 15 min , 1200 TRs ) and a second session of independent resting state data was used for validation tests , as well as independent data from task fMRI [18] .
Note that transformations map the cortical loci of a subject ’ s data matrices ( columns ) into the reference subject ’ s cortical loci .
Thus , we use the reference subject ’ s cortex for illustration , but note that the anatomical coordinates for model dimensions are an abstraction , as even the reference subject ’ s data are mapped into model space coordinates with a transformation matrix that is not the identity matrix .
Data matrices in the model space also can be mapped into any subject ’ s cortical anatomy by using the transpose of that subject ’ s transformation matrix ( Eq 4 ) .
Thus , the hyperaligned data in the common model space can be illustrated in any subject ’ s anatomical space .
The anatomical space that we use for illustration , that of the reference subject , should not be considered a canonical space but , rather , simply as one of many possible physical instantiations .
We define functional connectivities as the correlations of the response profiles - series of responses across time - of cortical loci or dimensions with the response profiles of targets ( tj ) distributed across the cortex .
We use two sets of connectivity targets , one reduced set to derive the transformation matrices and common model connectivity data matrix , and a more complete set to test the validity of the model .
We define a reduced set of connectivity targets using surface - searchlight target ROIs to make derivation of the model more computationally tractable , as compared to using all cortical loci as individual connectivity targets .
For the reduced set , we use 3852 targets ( top 3 components for 1284 searchlights ; note that the searchlights for connectivity targets are different from the searchlights that are hyperaligned as described above in the Resting State Data and Movie Data sections ; see details for defining searchlight PC connectivity targets in the next section ) .
For validation testing we analyze the full connectome , defining connectivity targets as all cortical loci in the brain ( Ncl = 54,034 gray matter voxels in the movie data and 59,412 cortical nodes in the HCP resting state data ) .
Each surface - searchlight connectivity target has a radius of 13 mm and is centered on a node of a coarse surface with a total of 1284 nodes covering both hemispheres .
Thus , neighboring connectivity targets searchlights are overlapping .
Unlike others ( e.g. , [5] ) we do not assume that a searchlight connectivity target has a single response profile .
We find , rather , a variety of response profiles for individual cortical loci in a target searchlight that can be captured as principal components .
We used the top three principal components to represent the response profiles in a target searchlight .
To insure that the top components in target searchlights capture the same connectivity patterns across subjects , we performed a singular value decomposition ( SVD ) on the group mean connectivity matrix for each target searchlight after a simplified hyperalignment of individual matrices .
Note that using a naive PCA / SVD to derive top components in each subject ’ s searchlight independently will not guarantee their functional similarity .
Target searchlights had a mean of 142 loci ( HCP data ) or 99 voxels ( movie data ) .
At this stage it was not yet possible to break the response profiles for searchlight targets into multiple components with shared connectivity profiles .
Consequently , connectivity targets for the procedure to derive these components were simply the mean time - series responses for target searchlights .
For each target searchlight with Ns features ( surface nodes or voxels ) , we computed a 1284 × Ns correlation matrix ( the correlations between each cortical locus in the target searchlight and the mean time series for all target searchlights ) for each subject .
We hyperaligned the features ( cortical loci ) in each target searchlight across subjects based on these matrices and calculated the mean correlation matrix after hyperalignment in each target searchlight .
We then performed a singular value decomposition ( SVD ) of each searchlight ’ s group mean matrix to obtain the top three components that explained the most shared variance .
Each of these components is a weighted sum of cortical loci in a target searchlight for each subject , and these weights afford calculation of a time - series response whose connectivity profile with other targets is shared across subjects .
Each individual subject ’ s time - series responses for the top three components were then used as target response profiles for CHA .
This step gave us 1284 × 3 = 3852 target response profiles in each subject ’ s cortex .
Validation tests and statistical analyses : In addition to analyzing the results of validation tests in each feature or searchlight across the whole cortex , we also examined the results of validation tests in functional ROIs associated with different sensory , perceptual , and cognitive functions to assess the general validity of the common model [16] .
We searched for terms and cortical areas implicated in visual , auditory , cognitive , and social functions in NeuroSynth [22] and took the coordinates for the peak location associated with each of 24 terms ( S1 Table ) .
For validation testing using the movie dataset , we used volume searchlights centered around those peak loci with a radius of 3 voxels as our functional ROIs .
For validation testing using the HCP dataset , we found the closest surface node corresponding to each peak locus and used a surface searchlight with a 10 mm radius around that surface node as the functional ROI .
Functional ROIs that were medial and encompassing both hemispheres in the volume space were split into left and right ROIs in the surface space resulting in 26 ROIs for tests on the HCP data .
For analyses of ISCs and PSFs of connectivity profiles in functional ROIs , we calculated the mean ISC or PSF across all cortical loci within the ROI searchlights ( Figs 3C , 4D , 5A , and 5C ) .
We used bootstrapping to test for significance of the contrasts between alignment methods by sampling subjects 10,000 times to compute 95 % CIs using BootES [51] .
We did this for each ROI and for the mean of all ROIs separately .
We used the same bootstrapping procedure for all validation tests unless specified otherwise .
Control for effect of filtering : In addition to the anatomically - aligned movie data and MSM - All aligned HCP resting state fMRI data , we calculated a third dataset that controls for the effect of filtering the data through CHA transformations but aligns those filtered data across subjects based on anatomical or MSM - All alignment .
To produce the filter control data , we created multiple common model connectomes using each subject as the reference .
Each subject ’ s connectome was transformed into the common connectome whose reference subject was the next subject in our order of subjects .
The last subject ’ s connectome was transformed into the common model connectome whose reference brain was that of the first subject .
Thus , each subject ’ s connectome is filtered by hyperalignment , but since the common model connectome for each subject has a different reference , the correspondence across filtered connectomes is based only on anatomical alignment and preserves the anatomical variability in the movie data and HCP datasets .
Intersubject correlation ( ISC ) of connectivity profile vectors : For validity testing we applied a more detailed definition of the connectome to measure fine - grained structure .
The connectivity profile vector for a feature ( or a cortical node or voxel ) was defined as the correlation of its time - series with of all other cortical nodes or voxels .
ISCs of connectivity profiles were computed between each subject ’ s connectivity profiles and the average connectivity profiles of all other subjects in each cortical locus .
For the movie data ISCs of connectivity profiles were computed within each movie half separately and before and after CHA based on the other half of the movie .
Correlation values were Fisher transformed before averaging across both halves of the movie in each voxel .
These were then averaged across all subjects and inverse Fisher transformed before mapping onto the cortical surface for visualization .
ISCs of resting state connectivity profiles were computed for session REST 2 .
Session REST 1 was used for deriving the common model connectome and transformation matrices .
ISCs were calculated for data mapped into the common model connectome , for movie data aligned anatomically , for HCP resting state data aligned with MSM - All , and for filter control movie and HCP data .
We also computed within - subject between - session ( REST 1 and REST 2 ) correlation of resting state connectivity profiles .
Within - subject between - sessions correlations were calculated on data that are transformed by CHA as used for our main analyses .
To investigate the spatial granularity of representation , we computed a spatial point spread function ( PSF ) of ISCs or WSCs of connectivity profiles .
We computed the correlation of connectivity profiles in each cortical locus ( surface node or voxel ) with the average connectivity profiles of cortical loci at varying cortical distances in other subjects ’ data .
To account for the effect of filtering , we did this analyses with filter control data that were filtered with CHA but aligned based on anatomy and MSM - All and after CHA with each subject aligned to the same reference subject [16] .
We computed similar PSFs for connectivity profiles within - subject between - sessions ( REST 1 and REST 2 ) .
This was also performed after CHA to account for any filtering effects but to a single common space as used for our main analyses .
ISCs of similarity structures were computed within each movie half separately using a searchlight of 3 voxel radius .
The mean number of voxels in these searchlights was 102 .
In each searchlight , similarity structure was computed as a matrix of correlation coefficients between patterns of response for every pair of time - points from that movie half for each subject .
The flattened upper triangle of this matrix excluding the diagonal was extracted as the profile of representational geometry at each searchlight for each subject .
ISC of representational geometry in each searchlight was computed as the correlation between each subject ’ s representational geometry and the average of all other subjects ’ representational geometries for that searchlight .
Correlation values were Fisher transformed before averaging across both movie halves in each voxel .
These were then averaged across all subject - average pairs and inverse Fisher transformed before mapping onto the cortical surface for visualization .
The same steps were performed to compute inter - subject correlation of representational similarity before and after hyperalignment .
Between - subject multivariate pattern classification ( bsMVPC ) : bsMVPC of 15 s movie time segments ( 6 TRs ) was computed within each movie half separately using searchlights of 3 voxel radius , as in the analysis of representational geometry .
bsMVPC was performed using a one - nearest neighbor classifier based on correlation distance [12,16] .
Each 15 s ( 6TR ) sequence of brain data for an individual was compared to other subjects ’ mean responses to that sequence and all other 15 s sequences in the same movie half using a sliding time window , resulting in over 1300 alternative time segments ( chance classification accuracy < 0.1 % ) .
Classification accuracies in each searchlight were averaged across both halves in each subject before mapping the subject means onto searchlight center voxels on the cortical surface for visualization .
We implemented our methods and ran our analyses in PyMVPA [45] ( http://www.pymvpa.org ) unless otherwise specified .
All preprocessing and analyses were carried out on a 64 - bit Debian 7.0 ( wheezy ) system with additional software from NeuroDebian [52] ( http://neuro.debian.net ) .
Study design and study participants : A cross - sectional survey was carried out recruiting a purposive sample of ST consumers in Dhaka , Bangladesh .
We recruited 200 current ST users aged 18 years or older , who were non - smokers ( either never smokers or former smokers who have not smoked for at least past one year ) .
Current ST users were defined as those using ST products for at least one year , with a minimum of one can or pouch of ST used per week .
Those with a history of other substance abuse or psychiatric illnesses were excluded .
Participants were recruited purposively from two urban cities in Dhaka , namely Mohakhali and Mirpur , through convenience sampling techniques , including snowball sampling and community referrals .
Trained field researchers recruited participants by visiting houses in these communities , at community gatherings , ST shops , and through personal referrals .
Researchers first approached local leaders in the study areas and people buying ST products from shops and explained the study objectives .
Local leaders and ST users gave references of their relatives , friends , and neighbours who use ST .
We recruited male and female ST users in equal proportion .
Taka 200 ( GBP 1.5 ) was paid to respondents as opportunity cost of their time .
Interviews and saliva sample collections were conducted at ST users ’ home or other mutually convenient place , such as their workplace .
Informed written consent was obtained from all study participants .
Data were collected between September and November 2014 .
This study was approved by the Bangladesh Medical Research Council ( BMRC ) and the Research Governance Committee at the University of York , UK .
A survey containing a set of questionnaires was administered by trained interviewers to collect information on the ; ( a ) socio - demographic characteristics , including age , sex , education , and household asset ownership ; and b ) tobacco use behaviours , i.e. quantity ( in grams ) of ST used per week , number of chews / dips per day ( DPD ) in the past week , duration of ST use in months , type of ST products used , swallowing of tobacco juices , urge and strength of urge to use ST , Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence ( FTND - ST ) , Tobacco Dependence Screener ( TDS ) , attempt to cut down on ST use in the past , and past smoking status .
ST products are generally sold in cans and packets that vary in weights .
We standardized our quantity estimates by showing participants cans and packets of 10 , 20 and 30 grams .
We asked the respondent to point out to the size of cans and packets they generally buy and how long does it take for them to consume these .
From this information , we estimated the amount of ST in grams consumed during an average week .
Measures of dependence , FTND - ST and TDS were adapted through the process of translation and back - translation , and cross - cultural validation for use in Bangladeshi culture and language .
Translation and back - translation was done by bilingual and bicultural translators outside the research team [16] .
To measure cotinine concentration , saliva samples were collected from all participants at the interviews using Salivette , oral swab and swab storage tube .
Saliva samples were taken at least 30 minutes after eating , drinking or taking medication .
A sterile cotton swab was tipped under the tongue without touching , and was left there until it became soggy .
This took up to five minutes .
The swab was then directly spat into the kit and closed firmly with the stopper .
The saliva samples were kept at the study centre at room temperature for a maximum of four days before being shipped to the UK and subsequently tested for cotinine at ABS Laboratories , UK .
The samples were frozen at - 20 degrees immediately on receipt in the UK and then thawed for analysis .
Cotinine was determined using a validated Liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) assay in human saliva using cotinine - d3 to internally standardize the procedure .
The method with a calibration range of 1 to 750 ng / mL was applied to this study as the samples were from subjects that chewed tobacco .
Cotinine was extracted from human saliva using 50 μ L of sample using liquid / liquid extraction with ethyl acetate .
The solvent was removed under nitrogen and the extract re - suspended in methanol for quantitative determination using Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography ( HILIC ) on a Thermo perfluorinated phenyl ( PFP ) column using LC - MS / MS with multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) on an Agilent 1100 LC system interfaced to an ABSciex API 4000 tandem mass spectrometer .
Analytical acceptance criteria were considered as specified by the Food and Drug Administration [14] .
Exploratory analysis of all variables was performed .
Geometric mean was calculated for salivary cotinine concentration across socio - demographic and tobacco use behaviours .
We also explored whether differences in proportion of tobacco use behaviours exist across sex of the participants .
Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to compute crude and adjusted estimates for association of variables with saliva cotinine levels .
Assumption of normality was not met for the bivariate analysis and saliva cotinine levels were positively skewed ; therefore we applied logarithmic transformation to salivary cotinine levels for statistical analyses .
Regression diagnostics were performed to evaluate multicollinearity and influential observations .
We set the cut off value of Variance Inflation Factor > 5 to exclude the factors from the final model [17] .
None of the variables met this criterion .
However only those variables that were significantly associated with cotinine levels in simple linear regression were included in the final model due to the limited sample size .
All analyses were performed using SAS v. 9.4 ( SAS Institute Inc . Cary , NC , USA ) and a level of 0.05 was used for statistical significance .
A systematic review of the literature was performed in August 22 , 2016 through Ovid ( https://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/ ) , which allows simultaneously searching of the following databases : MEDLINE , Embase , Allied and Complementary Medicine Database , CAB ABSTRACTS , PsycINFO ™ , and The Philosopher ' s Index .
By default , Ovid searches the following fields ( some of which are database - specific ) when all of its databases are searched : Title , Original Title , Title Comment , Abstract , Subject Heading Word , MeSH Subject Headings , Keyword Heading , Keyword Heading Word , Key Concepts , Full Text , Cited Reference Author Word and others .
The following search terms were used for breastfeeding : “ breastfe $ ” OR “ breast fe $ ” OR “ bottle fe $ ” OR “ formula fe $ ” OR “ infant feeding ” OR “ human milk ” OR “ breast milk ” OR “ formula milk ” OR “ weaning ” .
For epigenetics , the search terms were : “ epigenetic $ ” OR “ epigenom $ ” OR “ methylat $ ” OR “ methQTL ” OR “ mQTL ” .
Using the wildcard character “ $ ” retrieves any number ( including zero ) of characters after the stem word ( e.g. , “ breastfe $ ” retrieves “ breastfeeding ” , “ breastfed ” , etc ) .
The two group of search terms were combined using the AND operator : “ Breastfeeding ” AND “ Epigenetics ” .
Study selection and data collection : The aim of our review was to identify studies on DNA methylation differences associated with breastfeeding .
Studies were excluded if they met at least one of the following criteria : i ) not reporting effects of breastfeeding on DNA methylation ( e.g. , studies of epigenetic determinants of breastfeeding , such as the association between methylation in promoters of genes involved in breast milk production ) ; ii ) being limited to specific breast milk components rather than breastfeeding or breast milk as a whole ; iii ) not reporting original data .
Eligibility was assessed independently by two reviewers ( F.P .H . and C.L .M . ) , and disagreements were resolved by consensus .
Initially , duplicate records were excluded , titles screened and abstracts reviewed .
For the remaining studies , full - texts were examined .
The following data were extracted from the included studies : First author ’ s name and publication year .
Country where the study was conducted .
Study aim and design.Species , number of individuals , % of females and age .
Methylation region , DNA source , measurement method and outcome ( e.g. , proportion of methylated cells ) .
Breastfeeding categorisation ( e.g. , never vs . ever , duration in months , etc ) and age at ascertainment.Covariates .Breastfeeding - methylation association results .
Given the lack of consistency between the designs and methods among the studies ( as described below ) , we opted for a narrative review rather than attempting to perform a meta - analysis .
Records of confirmed presences of B . carambolae were obtained from the literature , as well as from online databases such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ( GBIF , http://www.gbif.org/ ) and SpeciesLink ( http://splink.cria.org.br/ ) .
When geo - referenced localities were not available ( only locality names ) , geographic coordinates were obtained with the software Google Earth .
Overall , 51 unique occurrence points were assembled , of which 36 points were from the native range and 15 points were from invaded areas in South America ( Suriname , French Guyana and Brazil - S1 Table ) .
The precise location of all surveyed occurrence were checked using the software Google Earth and only localities within the known distribution range of the species were used for analysis [11] .
In order to reduce spatial autocorrelation , these records were submitted to a spatial filtering , delimiting a minimum distance of 10km between each locality data [12,13] .
This is greater than the maximum dispersal distance of ≅ 5km reported for Bactrocera species , with the majority of individuals recaptured within 1 km from the release point [ 14 , 15 ] .
This procedure was performed using SDMtoolbox [16] , resulting in a total of 44 unique occurrence records .
Current climate data were obtained from the Worldclim database at the resolution of 2.5 arc - min ( available at http://www.worldclim.org ) [17] .
The Worldclim dataset is derived from measurements of monthly temperature and precipitation values collected from weather stations across the world between 1950 and 2000 [17] .
The predictor variables employed to assess current climate conditions were selected among nineteen bioclimatic variables that are widely used in studies of ecological niche modelling because they capture annual climatic ranges and limiting factors that are known to influence species geographic distribution [18] .
Climate space occupied by native and introduced populations : Projection of models onto another region relies on the assumption that invasive species conserve their climatic niche in the invaded regions [19] .
However , recent studies have demonstrated that species can change their realized climatic niche during invasion [19-21] .
A principal component analysis ( PCA ) was run using all environmental variables to compare the climate space occupied by native and invasive populations of B . carambolae .
A thousand random points from the native and invasive background were added to the PCA analysis ( see background selection below ) , and the first two components were plotted as a biplot , clustering the native and invasive populations with convex hulls to investigate niche overlap within the environmental space [22] .
ENMs were developed using a maximum entropy algorithm implemented in the software MaxEnt version 3.3.3k [23] .
MaxEnt is a general - purpose machine learning software that uses presence - only data [23] .
It has been widely used to predict species distribution , including tephritid species [4,22] and in addition to its robust statistical properties , MaxEnt shows a high performance across several niche modelling methods for presence - only data [24] .
Building models with an appropriate amount of complexity is critical to avoid over - and under - fitting [25] , and produce robust inference [26] , particularly when they are transferred to other geographic regions .
Model complexity was addressed with the following steps : ( i ) spatial filtering of occurrence data ( as previously described ) , ( ii ) using the geographically structured modeling approach [27] , ( iii ) reducing the number of environmental predictors through an a priori selection of uncorrelated variables , ( iv ) delimiting the study area , and ( v ) tuning experiments through different combinations of feature classes and regulation multiplier values .
A modified k - fold cross - validation ( commonly called masked geographically structured cross - validation ) was employed in the modelling process [27] .
Following this approach , occurrence data was partitioned in four groups based on spatial clustering of occurrence points [16] , rather than split the data randomly in groups of equal sample size , as the k - fold cross - validation implemented in MaxEnt .
Models were built using k - 1 groups for calibration , and then evaluated with the withheld group .
This method provides spatially independent evaluation data , and has been suggested for studies involving the transference of models across space [27,28] .
This procedure was performed using SDMtoolbox [16] .
Several studies have demonstrated that less complex and robust models can be produced by excluding highly correlated variables , because they do not add new information to the model [29,30] , and / or through a priori selection of variables based on their biological significance [29] .
Here , these two procedures were adopted for variable selection .
First , two sets of variables were selected and then the Pearson ’ s correlation test performed with the software ENMtools v 1.3 [31] was used to ensure the lack of multicolinearity among the selected predictors [32] .
The first set of predictors was selected based on previous studies that successfully modeled the distribution of other Bactrocera species [4,22] and included the following climatic variables : annual mean temperature ( Bio 1 ) , mean diurnal range ( Bio 2 ) , maximum temperature of warmest month ( Bio 5 ) , minimum temperature of coldest month ( Bio 6 ) , annual precipitation ( Bio 12 ) , precipitation of wettest ( Bio 13 ) and driest month ( Bio 14 ) .
Additionally , a second set of variables was employed by removing the variables Bio 5 and Bio 6 .
MaxEnt and most correlative ENMs generate pseudo - absence sample points randomly selected from the background study area [33] .
While some studies used a minimum convex polygon around the occurrence points as background , others adopted a less arbitrary selection based on biophysical classifications such as biomes [34] or climatic zones [22,35] .
Here , bioclimatic methods of background selection were adopted given their simplicity and practicality and because they have proved to be effective for other fruit fly species [22] .
The distribution records were intersected with Koppen - Geiger climate zones obtained from CliMond ( http://www.climond.org ) at the spatial resolution of 2.5 arc - minutes .
The climate zones containing one or more distribution records were used to restrict background during model training ( Fig 1 ) .

MaxEnt allows users to select a variety of “ feature classes ” that can be used to build very complex and highly nonlinear response curves [26] .
A feature is a function of an environmental variable , and in MaxEnt it can be a combination of six classes : linear ( L ) , quadratic ( Q ) , product ( P ) , hinge ( H ) and threshold ( T ) .
Because parsimonious models can be generated using different combinations of feature classes [36-38] , five of these combinations were tested in this study : L ; H ; LQ ; LQH and LQHPT .
While users can specify the feature to be used , MaxEnt automatically selects individual features for each predictor that contribute most to model fit using regularization coefficient β [23,26] .
The regularization coefficient can be tuned by multiplying it by a user - specified constant ( Regularization multiplier ) , altering the overall level of regularization rather than changing the β parameter individually [26,27] .
Studies have demonstrated that less complex and transferable models can be built by tuning the regularization multiplier to values higher than the default of MaxEnt [ 26 , 27 , 38 ] .
Therefore , in addition to MaxEnt default , regularization multiplier values of 3 and 5 were also tested in the development of the models .
The performance of the models was assessed using threshold - independent and threshold - dependent metrics .
As threshold - independent evaluation , the Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) and the Bayesian Information Criterion were used ( BIC ) .
For presence - background evaluations , AUC assess the discriminatory ability of the model , quantifying the probability that the model correctly ranks a random presence locality higher than a random background pixel [27] .
AUC values range from 0 to 1 ; a value of 0.5 indicates the model did not perform better than random ; values between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate poor performance ; between 0.7 and 0.9 indicate reasonable or moderate performance ; while values higher than 0.9 indicate high performance [10] .
Additionally , BIC was calculated with the software ENMtools v 1.3 [31] using the full data set .
BIC provides information on the relative quality of a model taking into account model complexity ( number of parameters ) and goodness - of - fit [25] .
Two threshold - dependent metrics were used to evaluate model performance : omission rates ( OR ) at the minimum training threshold ( MPT ) , and OR at 10 % training presence threshold ( TP 10 ) .
The expected value of OR at MTP is 0 and 0.10 at TP 10 .
Values higher than the expected indicate over - fitting and poor performance of the models [13,28] .
In order to select models with high performance and low complexity , the following criteria was adopted : OR at MTP and TP 10 closer to 0 and 0.10 , respectively , low BIC values and AUC values higher than 0.8 .
Once the best model was selected , it was projected onto other regions of the world to access the global potential distribution of B . carambolae .
Because models are calibrated based on the relationship between occurrence records and climate in the study area , projecting it onto other regions with non - analogous climatic conditions can be problematic , since the models are not informed about how species would respond to climatic novelty [39,40] .
To assess climate novelty in the transferred regions , a Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface test ( MESS ) implemented in MaxEnt was performed .
MESS is an index that expresses the similarity of any given point to a reference set of points , with respect to the chosen predictor variables [32] .
Negative values discriminate areas where at least one variable has a value that is outside the calibration range .
Additionally , we restricted model projections to climate conditions encountered during training by disabling extrapolate options in MaxEnt .
The final model was run with the logistic output and then binary maps displaying unsuitable and suitable environments were built using the thresholds MTP and TP 10 .
Areas above the MTP were referred as suitable , whereas areas above TP 10 were considered optimal for B . carambolae [41] .
A survey in the CABI database ( www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/8700 ) was conducted to assess the plants used as host by B . carambolae .
Based on this survey , the acreages of the following economically important fruit species were obtained for each Brazilian municipality in 2014 from the database of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE , available at www.ibge.gov.br ) : avocado , cashew , guava , orange , lemon , papaya , mango and tangerine ( S1 Fig ) .
In order to quantify the production areas at risk of attack , the suitability map of B . carambola were intersected against maps of fruit acreage in Brazil .
Municipalities that partially or totally overlapped with the predicted distributions of the carambola fruit fly were accounted as at risk of attack .
Both the acreage and the number of municipalities at risk of attack by B . carambolae were assessed .
Data collection was carried out in January and February , 2011 , by Opinion Matters , an international consumer research agency based in London .
All participants contacted directly ( i.e. , face - to - face ) provided written consent ; those participating on - line indicated their consent by clicking on a specific button on the initial web - page associated with the study , while those contacted via telephone provided verbal consent , which was noted in interview records .
All data collection protocols and research design were approved by the Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine .
All participants consented to scientific use of their responses prior to completing the survey questionnaire .
The original data will be made available to anyone who requests access . ( Requests can be made directly to the second author ) .
Questions were designed to address each of the factors in the model from Fig 1 .
The questionnaire was composed of 119 questions , plus 11 background questions about the age , gender , educational attainment and occupation of the respondent , as well as the regional location ( within country ) , demographic and material composition of their household . ( See Appendix 1 . ) The questionnaire was written in English and translated into the dominant mother - tongue and additional languages , where necessary , in non English - speaking countries by professional natives based in the country of the target language ( i.e. , French in France ; German in Germany ; Portuguese in Brazil ; Hindi and English in India ; Arabic and English in Saudi Arabia and UAE ; Bahasa and English in Malaysia ; French and English in Canada ; Simplified and Traditional Chinese in China ) .
All translations were carried out by one native speaker of the relevant country and then proof - read by a second professional native translator .
Translators were also asked to make amendments to the questionnaire ( if necessary ) to incorporate local knowledge and customs ( e.g. , demographic nuances ) and provided English translations for any of these changes .
Respondents were asked at the beginning of the questionnaire which language they would like to be interviewed in .
Twelve countries were chosen to represent each of the seven continents ( UK , USA , Canada , France , Germany , Australia , South Africa , Malaysia , Brazil , Middle East ) with the addition of the two most populated countries in the world ( China and India ) .
A sample size of 1000 per country was judged sufficient to establish representative patterns of response , as analyses would not involve more than twenty - five variables simultaneously , and 30 samples per variable is typically more than sufficient to achieve the standard level of statistical power to test hypotheses ( i.e. , tests with p < 0.05 ) .
Within - country samples were collected to reflect splits of gender , age , household income and geographical region , based on WHO data on each country ’ s population profile for these variables , so that each country ’ s sample was representative of the overall population in that country .
All households were also required to have ready access to a water source as a simple precondition to perform the target behaviours .
For cost - efficiency purposes , identification of respondents through on - line methods was preferred .
However , in some countries , not all respondents could not be identified in this way , as lower income respondents often do not have access to the web .
To make up a representative sample in these cases , potential participants for telephone or face - to - face interviews were identified at point of contact according to income .
The questionnaire was thus delivered through one of three means : online via an email invitation , via computer - assisted telephone interview ( CATI ) , or face - to - face ( see Table 1 ) .
In each case , question order was randomized in the actual delivery of the questionnaire ( with the exception of blocks of questions with a particular format , such as the personality test , and the background data section ) , in order to ensure that any biasing effects of prior priming of one question on another could be minimized .
We note that reviews find little influence of the means of administering questionnaires on reporting biases , which tend to be consistent across such methods .

Potential participants for online responses were identified using both the Opinion Matters online panel as well as trusted partners that adhere to the same strict codes of conduct and research guidelines .
These panels are actively - managed online global panels recruited for market research purposes .
All panelists have gone through a double opt - in process and have agreed to participate in paid online surveys , and to provide honest opinions for market research studies .
A wide range of recruitment processes are used to generate the panel including referral , Web advertising and public relations , to partner - recruited panels and alliances with heavily trafficked web portals .
Potential panelists were sent an invitation to participate in the survey via email , on a random basis within the target groups for the research .
A large number of respondents were eliminated by algorithms in the Globalpark software as the data collection process proceeded , using the following criteria : those whose answers were abnormally patterned ( e.g. , used the same response for a majority of questions , or answered the questionnaire too quickly , based on the average speed of questionnaire completion ) those missing a single response , either demographic or in the main questionnairethose screened out by not fitting into demographic quotas ( i.e. , respondents have to fulfil the demographic criteria to determine eligibility , and even if eligible , whether the quota for their profile is already full , before they can complete the questionnaire proper ) .
Respondents who fully completed questionnaires received points worth about US $ 3.00 which could then be redeemed for money or against charitable donations .
Safeguards ensured that respondents could not try to complete the questionnaire if it was not appropriate ( i.e. , they could not proceed unless they had ticked an answer for all questions on each page ; if there were alerts for contradictory answers , and so on ) .
Online responses took an average of 20 minutes to complete .
In some countries , it wasn ’ t possible to rely on panels or on - line respondents to achieve a sample representative of the country ’ s population .
In the cases of Brazil , China , India and Malaysia , datasets were augmented by the inclusion of a component collected via a computer - assisted telephone interviewing ( CATI ) method .
This involved random digit dialling .
Unlike the online case , no incentive was used for these respondents .
All such interviews were conducted by native language interviewers in each country using CATI - SPSS Dimensions software .
In the case of the Middle East and South Africa , face - to - face interviews were conducted because some segments of the population were known not to own land - line telephones , and hence could not be effectively reached via the CATI method .
The way the personal interviews were conducted varied slightly between these two territories .
In South Africa , interviewers targeted low - income areas to fulfill the quota stipulations and respondents were then randomly selected in that area .
People were approached in the street or a public place , asked the screening questions to verify that they met the screening criteria .
Respondents were interviewed and their responses were recorded on paper questionnaires and later inputted into the online research platform .
Respondents were incentivised with R 30 ( approx . 4 USD ) .
Interviews collected in this way lasted an average of 15 to 20 minutes .
In the Middle East , interviewers were briefed on the project and performed mock interviews before the beginning of the project .
Every interviewer was given a laptop with USB internet connection enabling him / her to conduct the interview from any location .
Interviews were therefore carried out at respondents ’ homes , coffee shops , malls , internet cafes , or at universities ( especially for younger age groups ) .
In principle , incentives were not offered for such interviews ; however , in some cases ( where interviews were done outside the home ) , interviewers offered the respondent a cup of coffee , juice or cake .
The average interview length varied between 25 to 35 minutes .
Online responses were exported from an integrated research platform ( Globalpark ) by Opinion Matters personnel into a survey reporting software program ( SNAP ) , and from thence were converted into an Excel spreadsheet .
Interviewers recorded telephone and face - to - face responses by hand onto printed data - sheets which were then transcribed into electronic records in an Excel database using codes consistent with the on - line records .
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Committee at Children ’ s Hospital of Soochow University .
Informed consent was signed by subject guardians .
All experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the institution guidelines regarding the acquisition and experimental use of human tissues .
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 48 patients common bile duct dilation hospitalized between January 2009 and December 2014 .
Inclusion criteria of PBM was 1 ) the common channel is longer than 5 mm by MRCP and combined by intraoperative cholangiography ( IOC ) ; 2 ) patients with 5 mm or longer common channel had biliary amylase ( obtained by IOC ) > 1,000 U / L .
If the cases do not meet these criteria , then the cases were diagnosed as CCC .
MRCP was performed before diagnosing of PBM in all cases .
Before MRCP , all subjects were maintained in jejunitas for 4 h then MRCP was performed with sedation for subjects 10 years - of - age or younger .
A Symphony 1.5 T scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) with an abdominal phased array coil was used as follows : T1 - weighted and T1 - weighted fast spin series ( field of view 24 - 28 cm , repetition time [ TR ] 173 ms , echo time [ TE ] 2.64 ms , flip angle 70 , matrix 256 * 128 , radiofrequency ( RF ) bandwidth 260 Hz / Px ) and a T2 - weighted sequence ( TR 1,000 ms , TE 60 ms , RF bandwidth 230 Hz / Px ) .
For MRCP , half - Fourier acquisition single shot turbo spin echo ( HASTE ) was used with multilayer thin coronal and axial T2 - weighted imaging ( TR 1,200 ms , TE 80 ms , slice thickness 4 mm ) .
Oblique thick slabs were acquired in the planes of the common bile and pancreatic ducts .
For multi - angle imaging , TR was 4,500 ms , TE 950 ms and slice thickness 60 mm were used .
Two radiologists who were unaware of the pathological findings independently reviewed the images and reached consensus through discussion .
A diagnosis of PBM was established if the common channel is longer than 5 mm .
They also assess the shape of the intrahepatic bile duct and gallbladder , pancreatitis , surgical pathology , symptom profiles , operative notes and pathological records were compared with the imaging findings .
Forty - eight CCC patients were assessed for gender , age , biliary amylase and MRCP findings and two groups were established : PBM and non - PBM .
Within these groups , age , gender , common bile duct shape , distal position of papilla of Vater , cyst stones and cyst size , gallbladder and pancreatic duct dilation and CCC were assessed as was stomach , duodenal , and small bowel fluid .
MRCP helped classify cysts as being smaller or larger than 30 mm .
Ages were grouped as infant ( younger than one year - of - age ) or pediatric ( older than one year - of - age ) as well .
Stomach fluid was documented to occur in the gastric fundus or body and duodenal fluid was defined as occurring in the second , third , or fourth duodenal portion and small bowel fluid was defined as occurring in the lower left or the lower and middle abdominal area .
Pancreatic duct dilation was defined as dilation greater than 1 mm .
Descending cysts were obviously apparent in the introitus pelvis .
Data are presented as number ( n ) and percentage .
Univariate comparisons were made using a nonparametric one - way Wilcoxon rank sum , a χ 2 , or Fisher ’ s exact test ; depending on statistical distribution .
To evaluate risk factors affecting diagnosing PBM by MRCP , a stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed with SAS 8 . 0 .
P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
All participants gave their written informed consent to take part in the study , in line with the Declaration of Helsinki , and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the University of Liege .
Twenty - six right - handed native French - speaking young adults ( 15 women ) , with no diagnosed psychological or neurological disorders , were recruited from the university community .
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Liege , and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards described in the Declaration of Helsinki ( 1964 ) .
All participants gave their written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study .
Age ranged from 18 to 28 years , with a mean of 20.9 years .
Minimal number of years of education was 14 .
In a first fMRI session , the order STM and alphabetical order judgment conditions were administered , including also the luminance judgment control condition .
For each STM trials , the encoding phase consisted of the presentation of a list of six letters ( e.g. , ‘ D , C , I , F , J , A ’ ) ordered horizontally ( fixed duration : 2500 msec ) ( see also Figure 1 ) .
For the maintenance phase , a fixation cross was displayed for a variable duration ( random Gaussian distribution centered on a mean duration of 4500 ± 1500 msec ) .
Finally , the retrieval phase consisted of an array of two probe stimuli ordered vertically , in order to eliminate the possibility that the task could be completed by mere visuo - spatial matching between the target and probe stimuli .
Participants indicated within 3000 msec if order information for the two probe stimuli matched information in the memory list ( by pressing the button under the middle finger for ‘ yes ’ and by pressing the button under the index for ‘ no ’ ) .
More specifically , participants judged whether the probe letter presented on the top of the screen had occurred in a more leftward position in the memory list than the probe letter presented on the bottom of the screen .
The positional distance varied from 2 to 5 , while keeping alphabetical distance constant ( distance of 3 ) .
We used letters from A to I which were also the same letters used in the alphabetical order judgment task .
In the alphabetical order judgment task , the participants saw two letters displayed vertically on the screen and they had to decide within 3000 msec whether they were displayed in correct alphabetical order .
The participants responded by pressing the button under their index finger for ‘ no ’ responses and the button under their middle finger for ‘ yes ’ responses .
The distances varied from 2 to 5 alphabetical positions .
In order to favor automatic access to ordinal information , only the first nine letters of the alphabet were used .
The number of distances was mainly determined by the STM task where we used a STM load of 6 items , which is known to challenge STM capacities without leading to floor effects [8] , [27] .
We did not assess distances of 1 position since several studies had observed a reverse distance effect for alphabetical order judgment [29] , [30] as well as for order STM judgments especially for consecutive pairs in ascending order [9] .
The luminance judgment control condition [24] consisted of the presentation of two identical letters ( ‘ A ’ ) displayed in white font on a black screen at identical or different luminance levels .
The participants had to decide within 3000 msec whether luminance levels were the same or not by pressing the button under their index finger for ‘ no ’ and the button under their middle finger for ‘ yes ’ .
We manipulated two different luminance levels ( close versus further apart ) in the luminance baseline condition in order to control for general executive processes associated with comparison judgments for highly similar versus dissimilar stimuli in the tasks - of - interest , and hence to isolate neural substrates associated with ordinal judgments and comparison processes as specifically as possible .
The photometric luminance difference between the two letters was either small ( close distance = difference of 80 cd / m2 hue - saturation - brightness ) or large ( far distance = difference of 160 cd / m2 hue - saturation - brightness ) .
In order to control for processes associated with basic letter processing in the STM task , the luminance judgment trials were furthermore preceded by the presentation of six identical letters ( ‘ A ’ ) organized horizontally and which the participants viewed passively ( see Figure 1 ) .

For each condition , a negative probe trial is illustrated .
Finally , the neural substrates associated with ordinal distance effects for numerical information were assessed in a second session , using a numerical order judgment task based on the seminal paradigm developed by Pinel et al . [21] .
After a fixation cross ( 250 msec ) , participants were presented a number ( e.g. , ‘ 45 ’ ; duration 1000 msec ) and had to judge whether the number comes before or after the numerical standard ‘ 65 ’ ; the same standard was used for all trials [21] .
The participants pressed on the button under the index finger for before - standard responses , and on the button under the middle finger for after - standard responses .
The distances between the probe and the standard ranged from 1 - 7 units [ distances 1 ( 60 - 64 and 66 - 70 ) , 2 ( 55 - 59 and 71 - 75 ) , 3 ( 50 - 54 and 76 - 80 ) , 4 ( 45 - 49 and 81 - 85 ) , 5 ( 40 - 44 and 86 - 90 ) , 6 ( 35 - 39 and 91 - 95 ) , and 7 ( 30 - 34 and 96 - 99 ) ] .
Given the relative long duration of the tasks administered in the first session , they were always presented first , and the numerical task was always presented in the second session , in order to diminish fatigue effects and to increase task compliance .
For the order STM and alphabetical judgment conditions there were 24 trials per ordinal distances .
For the luminance judgment control condition , there were 20 trials by distance .
For the numerical order judgment task there were 20 trials for distances 1 to 6 and 18 trials for the distance 7 .
For each condition and distance , there was an equal number of trials requiring a ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ response .
For each session and condition , the different trials were presented in pseudorandom order , with the restriction that 2 successive trials of the same distance and condition could not be separated by more than 5 trials of a different condition ( i.e. , by more than 65 s on average ) in order to keep blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signals for same condition epochs away from the lowest frequencies in the time series .
Before the start of a new trial , a cue informing about task condition appeared on the top of the screen during 1000 msec .
The duration of the intertrial interval was variable ( random Gaussian distribution centered on a mean duration of 2000 ± 500 msec ) and further varied as a function of the participants ’ response times : the probe array disappeared immediately after a response was recorded .
If the participant did not respond within 3000 msec , “ no response ” was recorded and the next trial began .
Both response accuracy and response times were collected .
Finally , a practice session outside the magnetic resonance environment , prior to the start of the experiment , familiarized the participants with the specific task requirements and included the administration of 10 practice trials .
Data were acquired on a 3 - Tesla scanner ( Siemens , Allegra , Erlangen , Germany ) using a T2 * - sensitive gradient - echo EPI sequence ( TR = 2040 msec , TE = 30 msec , field of view ( FOV ) = 192 × 192 mm 2 , 64 × 64 matrix , 3 mm in - plane resolution , 34 axial slices with 3 mm thickness , and 25 % interslice gap to cover most of the brain .
The 3 initial volumes were discarded to avoid T1 saturation effects .
Field maps were generated from a double - echo gradient recalled sequence ( TR = 517 msec , TE = 4.92 and 7.38 msec , FOV = 230 × 230 mm 2 , 64 × 64 matrix , 34 transverse slices with 3 mm thickness and 25 % gap , flip angle = 90 ° , bandwidth = 260 Hz / pixel ) and used to correct echo - planar images for geometric distortion due to field inhomogeneities .
A high - resolution T1 - weighted magnetization - prepared rapid gradient echo image was acquired for anatomical reference ( TR = 1960 msec , TE = 4.4 msec , time to inversion = 1100 msec , FOV = 230 × 173 mm 2 , matrix size 256 × 192 × 176 , voxel size 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 mm 3 ) .
For the first session ( STM , alphabetical and luminance judgment ) , between 1134 and 1272 functional volumes were obtained .
For the second session ( numerical order judgment ) , between 346 and 392 functional volumes were obtained .
Head movement was minimized by restraining the subject ' s head using a vacuum cushion .
Stimuli were displayed on a screen positioned at the rear of the scanner , which the subject could comfortably see through a mirror mounted on the standard head coil .
Data were preprocessed and analyzed using SPM 8 software ( Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience , www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ) implemented in MATLAB ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) .
EPI time series were corrected for motion and distortion using “ Realign and Unwarp ” [31] using the generated field map together with the Fieldmap toolbox [32] provided in SPM 8 .
A mean realigned functional image was then calculated by averaging all the realigned and unwarped functional scans , and the structural T1 image was coregistered to this mean functional image ( rigid body transformation optimized to maximize the normalized mutual information between the 2 images ) .
The mapping from subject to Montreal Neurological Institute space was estimated from the structural image with the “ unified segmentation ” approach [33] .
The warping parameters were then separately applied to the functional and structural images to produce normalized images of resolution 2 × 2 × 2 mm 3 and 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 , respectively .
The scans were screened for motion artifacts and time series with movements exceeding 3 mm ( translation ) or 3 ° ( rotation ) were discarded ; this resulted in the removal of the data of 2 participants not presented here .
Finally , the warped functional images were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full - width at half maximum ( FWHM ) .
For each subject brain responses were estimated at each voxel , using a general linear model with epoch regressors and event - related regressors .
For the order STM and luminance judgment conditions , regressors were defined to cover encoding , maintenance and retrieval phases .
Encoding and maintenance phases were modeled via a single regressor due to the short duration of the encoding phase leading to high autocorrelation between these two phases .
The encoding - maintenance regressor ranged from the onset of each trial until the onset of the probe display .
On this basis , we obtained two linear contrasts corresponding to the encoding - maintenance phase of order STM and luminance judgment conditions .
For the order STM retrieval stage , as well as the alphabetical ordinal judgment , the luminance judgment retrieval stage and the numerical order judgment conditions , the regressor ranged from the onset of the probe display to the participant ’ s response .
In order to ensure minimal autocorrelation between the two phase - specific regressors , the encoding / maintenance regressors for luminance and order STM was further orthogonalized relative to the other two retrieval regressors [4] , [5] , [10] , [27] , [34] : Shared variance between retrieval and late encoding / maintenance phases was attributed to the retrieval regressor .
On this basis , for each condition , one linear contrast was performed , one for the encoding / maintenance phase of order STM , one for the retrieval phase of order STM and one for the alphabetical order judgment ; for each of these contrasts , the corresponding luminance baseline events were subtracted .
After that , for each subject and each condition , a parametric design was defined in order to highlight voxels sensitive to ordinal distance effects .
For the order STM retrieval phase , the ordinal letter judgment , the luminance judgment and the numerical order judgment tasks , the regressor ranged from the onset of the probe display to the participant ’ s response with a parametric modulation for each distance .
For each parametric design , the model included a regressor looking at activation whose intensity was modulated linearly by numerical / positional / alphabetical / luminance distance , plus their time derivatives .
This model was applied for each task condition resulting in one target contrast for each condition .
These contrasts were then entered in second - level analyses , corresponding to random effects models .
One - sample t - tests for each phase of the STM , as well as for the alphabetical order judgment and the numerical order judgment were used to identify cerebral correlates of each condition for the task - related and distance effects .
Null conjunction analyses assessed the commonality of activation profiles associated with the parametric distance effects across the different tasks [35] by exclusively masking for activation due to the luminance distance effect condition but also the brain activation differences between the each condition .
For each model , the design matrix also included the realignment parameters to account for any residual movement - related effect .
A high - pass filter was implemented using a cutoff period of 128 sec in order to remove the low - frequency drifts from the time series .
Serial autocorrelations were estimated with a restricted maximum likelihood algorithm with an autoregressive model of order 1 ( + white noise ) .
The resulting set of voxel values constituted a map of t statistics [ SPM ( t ) ] .
All contrast images were then smoothed again ( 6 - mm FWHM Gaussian kernel ) in order to reduce remaining noise due to intersubject differences in anatomical variability in the individual contrast images .
Statistical inferences were performed at the voxel level at p < .05 , with FWE - corrections for multiple comparisons across the entire brain volume , as well as using small volume corrections for a priori locations of interest [36] .
A Priori Locations of Interest : Regions of interest concerned the anterior and posterior bilateral IPS , based on aforementioned studies associating the anterior part of the horizontal of the IPS to processing of ordinal information in STM and numerical processing tasks , and associating the posterior part of the IPS to attentional control processes .
The small volume correction was computed on a 10 mm radius sphere around the averaged coordinates published for the corresponding location of interest namely bilateral anterior IPS ( − 42 , − 42 , 40 and 44 , − 40 , 44 ) [4] , [5] , [10] , [24] , [37] and bilateral posterior IPS ( − 26 , − 62 , 46 ; 28 , − 58 , 40 ) [27] , [28] .
Animals were derived from the C57B L / 6J strain obtained from Jackson Labs ( Bar Harbor , ME ) due to their common use in genetic crossing and maintaining genetically modified mouse lines .
The mice were group housed in the small animal facility at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences of Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( Cambridge , MA ) with a 12 - hr light dark cycle and ad libitum feeding .
All experiments were conducted in compliance with the humane animal care standards outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and were reviewed and approved by the MIT Committee on Animal Care ( CAC ) .
The protocol number is 0609 - 060 - 12 , approval date July 27 , 2010 .
Generation of region - specific Cdk 5 mutant mice : We constructed a targeting vector in which two loxP sequences were inserted into the Cdk 5 gene .
The first loxP sequence was placed before exon 1 and the second loxP sequence was placed between exons 5 and 6 so that they flanked exons 1 - 5 of the twelve total exons in the Cdk 5 genomic sequence .
The mice homozygous for the loxP - Cdk 5 - loxP sequence ( henceforth named “ floxed Cdk 5 ” or simply ‘ Cdk5f / f ’ ) were generated through standard homologous recombination procedures ( Figure S1A - B ) .
The Cdk 5 - loxP construct was linearized by Pme 1 digestion and electroporated into embryonic stem cells .
The homologous recombinant clones were identified by Southern blot ( see next section ) .
The chimeric mice were crossed to Flp transgenic mice ( Susan Dymecki ) to remove the neomycin cassette .
Floxed mice were genotyped using the PCR primer sequences : ( forward ) cagtttctagcacccaactgatgta and ( reverse ) gctgtcctggaactccatctataga cagtttctagcacccaactgatgta and reverse : gctgtcctggaactccatctataga .
Floxed Cdk 5 mice were maintained on a C57B L / 6 background .
For region - specific ablation of Cdk 5 , we used mouse lines predominantly expressing Cre in excitatory neurons of hippocampal areas CA 1 or CA 3 and forebrain .
We crossed Cdk5f / f mice with Cre transgenic mice , T29 - 2 , which mediate Cre / loxP recombination predominantly in CA 1 pyramidal cells [24] , [25] to generate Cdk5f / f / T29 mice ( CreT 29 - 2 ; fCdk 5 / fCdk 5 ) .
Cdk5f / f / CW 2 mice were generated by crossing the CW - 2 Cre mice to the Cdk5f / f mice [28] in order to ablate Cdk 5 in excitatory neurons of the forebrain .
To create Cdk5f / f / KA 1 mice , we crossed Cdk5f / f mice with Cre transgenic mice , G32 - 4 , which express Cre predominantly in CA 3 pyramidal cells [3] .
We confirmed CA 1 , forebrain , and CA 3 Cre expression pattern by crossing the Cre lines to the ROSA 26 - EYFP line [63] .
For the following experiments , we used Cdk 5 homozygous floxed littermates ( Cdk5f / f ) as controls .
Cdk5f / f / T29 , Cdk5f / f / CW 2 , and Cdk5f / f / KA 1 mice are viable and do not exhibit any obvious developmental defects , in contrast to the embryonic lethality of Cdk 5 KO mice produced by conventional gene knockout strategies [64] .
We confirmed the ablation of Cdk 5 in areas CA 1 or CA 3 by immunohistochemistry .
Cdk 5 is expressed in most areas of the mouse brain .
In the hippocampus , we found that Cdk 5 expression level in area CA 1 was decreased in Cdk5f / f / T29 mice compared to controls .
Importantly , there were no differences in Cdk 5 expression levels between the Cdk5f / f / T29 and control mice in area CA 3 and dentate gyrus ( DG ) .
Cdk 5 immunoreactivity in CA 3 was reduced in the Cdk5f / f / KA 1 mice compared to controls .
Cdk 5 was absent in the cell bodies of pyramidal cells in area CA 1 of the Cdk5f / f / T29 mice and in area CA 3 of Cdk5f / f / KA 1 mice .
Morphological and histochemical examinations did not reveal obvious abnormalities in brains from Cdk5f / f / T29 , Cdk5f / f / CW 2 , or Cdk5f / f / KA 1 mice ( Figures S1 , S2 , S3 ) .
Tissues collected from micro - dissected area CA 1 of the Cdk5f / f / T29 versus control mice ( Cdk5f / f ) revealed that Cdk 5 protein levels are largely reduced in the CA 1 region of these mice .
The following modified protocol was used : tail lysis overnight , followed by DNA extraction .
Ten μ g of genomic DNA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI overnight , followed by electrophoresis on a 0.8 % agarose gel .
The gel was then incubated in 2 gel volumes of 0.25 M HCl for 20 min at room temperature , briefly rinsed with ddH2O , then incubated in 2 gel volumes of denaturation buffer ( 0.5 M NaOH , 1.5 M NaCl ) two times , 15 min each .
The gel was briefly rinsed with ddH2O and subsequently incubated in 2 gel volumes of renaturation buffer two times , 30 min each .
The transfer was set up overnight on a sandwich consisting of 3 cm high paper towel stack , the agarose gel , a nitrocellulose membrane ( Micron Separation , Inc . ) , and filter paper with a bridge .
The membrane was then rinsed and baked in a 80 ° C oven under a vacuum for 2 hr , rinsed 2 times in 2X SSC buffer ( for 1 L 20X SSC : 3 M NaCl , 0.3 M Sodium Citrate , pH 7.0 ) , and prehybridized in ULTRAHTb ( Ambion ) for 1 hr at 42 ° C in the hybridization chamber .
The probe was made using a DECAprime II kit ( Ambion , Cat # 1455 ) .
The reaction was incubated at 37 ° C for 7 min , terminated by 1 μ l 0.5M EDTA , and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using spin columns ( NuAway , Ambion ) .
Radiolabel incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter .
107 cpm per ml of probe was transferred to the prehybridized blot and incubated overnight at 42 ° C .
The membrane was then washed sequentially : 2X SSC , 0.1 % SDS for 20 min at 65 ° C , 0.1X SSC , 0.1 % SDS for 20 min three times at 65 ° C .
The blot was then dried and developed with film .
Adult ( 2.5 - 3.5 month old ) mice were used for all behavior , biochemical , and immunohistochemistry studies .
We observed that the Cre expression in the T29 - 2 line is no longer restricted to the CA 1 region in 4 - month - old mice .
Interestingly , the spreading of Cre expression in these mice , and thus Cdk 5 knockdown , occurs at a time when the Cdk5f / f / T29 mice begin to suffer seizures , and these mice begin to die around 6 - 8 months of age .
Cdk5f / f / KA 1 mice appear to be normal even after 1 year of age .
Training consisted of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box ( context ) followed by a foot shock ( 2 sec , 0.5 / 0.8 / 1.0 mA , constant current ) .
The memory test was performed 24 hr later by re - exposing the mice to the conditioning context for 3 min .
Freezing , defined as a lack of movement except for heartbeat and respiration associated with a crouching posture , was recorded every 10 sec by two trained observers ( one was blind to the experimental conditions ) during the 3 min trial for a total of 18 sampling intervals .
The mean number of observations indicating freezing from both observers was expressed as a percentage of the total number of observations .
Training consisted of a 3 min exposure of mice to the conditioning box , followed by a tone ( 30 sec , 20 kHz , 75 dB sound pressure level ( SPL ) and a foot shock ( 2 sec , 0.8 mA , constant current ) [65] .
The memory test was performed 24 hr later by exposing the mice for 3 min to a novel context followed by an additional 3 min exposure to a tone ( 20 kHz , 75 dB SPL ) .
Freezing was recorded every 10 sec by two trained observers as described above .
The water maze with hidden platform paradigm [1] was performed in a circular tank ( diameter 1.8 m ) filled with opaque water .
A platform ( 11 × 11 cm ) was submerged below the water ' s surface in the center of the target quadrant .
The swimming path of the mice was recorded by a video camera and analyzed by the Videomot 2 software ( TSE ) .
For each training trial , the mice were placed into the maze consecutively from one of four random points of the tank .
Mice were allowed to search for the platform for 60 s .
If the mice did not find the platform within 60 s , they were gently guided to it .
Mice were allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s .
Two consecutive training trials were given every day ; the latency for each trial was recorded for analysis .
During the memory test ( probe test ) , the platform was removed from the tank , and the mice were allowed to swim in the maze for 60 s .
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously [66] .
Briefly , brains were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with antibodies against Cdk 5 and pCREB .
Five random fields from each experiment were obtained and quantified with the observer blind to genotype .
The antibodies and dilutions used were as follows .
For immunohistochemistry : Cdk 5 ( MBS 240590 , MyBioSource , 1 ∶ 800 ) ; pCREB ( S133 ) ( Millipore 06 - 519 , 1 ∶ 200 ) .
Immunoblotting was performed on mouse forebrains or microdissected hippocampi .
Brain lysates were obtained by dounce homogenization of tissue in radioimmunoprecipitation ( RIPA ) buffer .
The RIPA buffer composition is as follows : 50 mM Tris pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP − 40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % SDS with protease and phosphatase inhibitor tablets ( Roche ) .
Lysates were incubated on ice and cleared with a 13,000 rpm spin and protein content was quantified ( BCA protein assay , Bio - Rad Technologies ) .
Ten micrograms of protein was diluted with 2X sample buffer consisting of the following : 100 mM Tris pH 6.8 , 4 % SDS ( w / v ) , 0.2 % bromophenol blue ( w / v ) , 20 % glycerol ( v / v ) , 200 mM DTT .
Samples were boiled at 95 ° C for 5 minutes and resolved on a 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel with 8 % stacking gels using Laemmli buffer .
Proteins were transferred by electrophoresis using tris - glycine wet transfer onto PVDF membranes ( Millipore ) for 1 hr on ice .
After blocking with blocking buffer ( 5 % non - fat dry milk / 0.1 % Tween - 20 / TBS ) for 1 hr , membranes were probed with various antibodies overnight at 4 ° C .
Membranes were washed three times using 0.1 % Tween - 20 / TBS , incubated with secondary antibodies ( enhanced chemiluminescence mouse or rabbit IgG , HRP - Linked F ( ab ' ) 2 fragment from sheep , GE Healthcare , diluted at 1 ∶ 15,000 ) for 1 hr at room temperature .
Membranes were washed again and developed using Western Lightning ECL substrate ( Perkin Elmer ) .
All antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer .
Membrane stripping ( before reprobing ) was performed with stripping buffer : ( 2 % SDS , 62.5 mM Tris - HCL pH 6.8 , 100 mM 2 - mecaptoethanol ) and incubation for 30 minutes at 50 ° C ( with rocking ) , followed by two washing steps with excess TBST , and blocking as usual .
Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ ( NIH ) .
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software .
Antibodies used for immunoblots : Cdk 5 ( DC - 17 , Tsai laboratory , 1 ∶ 500 ) ; pCaMKII ( T286 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology # 3361 , 1 ∶ 2000 ) ; pCREB ( S133 ) ( Millipore 06 - 519 , 1 ∶ 2000 ) ; pGluR 1 ( S845 ) ( Chemicon Ab 5849 ) ; pGluR 1 ( S831 ) ( Chemicon , Ab 5847 ) ; GluR 1 ( Abcam ) ; pPP 1 ( Cell Signal 2581 ) ; pp1a ( Abcam ) ; DARRP - 32 T75 ( Cell Signal # 2301 ) ; DARRP - 32 T34 ( Cell Signal # 2304 ) ; actin ( Sigma # 5316 ) .
Whole hippocampi were dissected and homogenized in 3.75 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7.4 , 15 mM KCl , 3.75 mM NaCl , 250 μ M EDTA , 50 μ M EGTA , 30 % ( w / v ) sucrose , 30 % ( v / v ) glycerol , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) , 100 μ M PMSF using a Dounce homogenizer , then centrifuged ( 1000 g , 10 min ) .
For each sample , the supernatant ( cytoplasmic fraction ) and pellet ( nuclear fraction ) were separated .
Each fraction was resuspended in the same buffer without sucrose , but including 15 mM PMSF , using a Dounce homogenizer then triturated with a 26 G syringe before purification on PiResin ( Innova Biosciences ) .
Phosphatase activity was determined by incubating 2 μ L sample with 0.15 mM RII substrate ( BIOMOL ) and 5 nM tautomycin ( to inhibit PP 1 ) or 5 nM tautomycin + OA ( to inhibit PP 1 and PP2A activity ) in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7.0 , 100 μ M Na2EDTA , 5 mM DTT , 0.01 % Brij 35 at 30 ° C for 10 min .
The reaction was terminated by adding TCA followed by centrifugation ( 13,000 g , 5 min ) .
The amount of free phosphates released in the reaction was measured with BIOMOL Green reagent ( BIOMOL ) at 620 nm and background - subtracted .
For total phosphatase activity , tautomycin and OA were removed from the reaction .
PP 1 and PP2A activity was calculated using the ratio of phosphatase activity with inhibitors and total phosphatase activity .
Three to four month old Cdk5f / f / T29 mice or their Cdk5f / f control littermates were sacrificed by cervical dislocation , and hippocampi were rapidly dissected in ice - cold oxygenated artificial CSF ( ACSF ) .
Transverse hippocampal slices ( 400 μ m thick ) were placed in a chamber and continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF consisting of ( in mM ) : 119 NaCl , 2.5 KCl , 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1.3 MgSO 4 , 1 NaH2PO 4 , 26.2 NaHCO 3 , 11 D - glucose , pH 7.4 .
A bipolar stimulating electrode ( 0.002 in diameter nichrome wire ; A - M Systems ) placed in the stratum radiatum was used to elicit action potentials in CA 3 Schaffer collateral axons .
An ACSF - filled glass microelectrode with a resistance between 0.5 and 3 M Ω was placed in the stratum radiatum region of area CA 1 and was used to record the field excitatory post - synaptic potentials ( fEPSP ) .
Data were acquired using HEKA EPC 10 and analyzed by Patchmaster ( HEKA ) .
Peak fEPSP amplitudes from stimulators were required to be at least 2 mV , and stimulus intensity was set to produce 40 % of the maximal response .
Baseline responses were recorded for 20 min .
fEPSPs were evoked at area CA 1 synapses by stimulating Schaffer collaterals at a low frequency ( 2 per min ) to establish a stable baseline .
Immediately following LTP induction with 2 trains of high - frequency stimulation ( HFS , 100 Hz , 1 s ) , with an interval of 20 s , slices from Cdk5f / f / T29 and control Cdk5f / f mice showed an increase in fEPSP slope and amplitude , suggesting that short - term potentiation ( STP ) occurs in all groups .
Forebrains from Cdk5f / f and Cdk5f / f / CW 2 mice were homogenized and postsynaptic densities ( PSD ) isolated in ice - cold buffers with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails ( Roche ) as previously described with minor modifications [67] .
Briefly , mouse forebrains were isolated and homogenized in ice - cold Buffer A ( 0.32 M Sucrose , 6 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM CaCl 2 ) with a Teflon homogenizer ( 15 strokes ) .
Homogenized brain extracts were spun at 1400 × g for 10 min .
The supernatant ( S1 ) was saved and the subsequent pellet ( P1 ) was homogenized again ( 5 strokes ) .
After centrifugation at 700 × g , the supernatant ( S1 ' ) was saved and pooled with S1 .
Pooled S1 and S1 ' was centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 10 min to collect the pellet ( P2 ) .
P2 was resuspended in Buffer B ( 0.32 M Sucrose , 6 mM Tris pH 8 ; 5 strokes ) .
The P2 suspension was loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient ( 0.85 M / 1 M / 1.15 M sucrose solution in 6 mM Tris , pH 8.0 ) , followed by centrifugation for 2 h at 82,500 × g in a SW - 41 rotor .
The synaptosome fraction between 1 M and 1.15 M sucrose was collected with a syringe needle and adjusted to 4 ml with Buffer B . Equal volumes of Buffer C ( 12 mM Tris pH 8 ; 1 % Triton X - 100 ) was added and mixed for 15 min and then spun at 32,800 × g in a Ti 70.1 rotor for 20 min .
The PSD - enriched pellet was resuspended in 40 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) and protein concentration was measured using a BCA assay .
To prepare samples for mass spectrometry , solubilized PSD proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 60 ° C .
After cooling to room temperature , the sample was then alkylated with 25 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature .
After adding 2X sample buffer ( 100 mM Tris pH 6.8 , 200 mM DTT , 4 % SDS , 0.2 % Bromophenol blue , 20 % glycerol ) , the PSD samples were then boiled at 95 ° C for 5 min and 30 μ g of each sample was loaded for separation on an 4 - 12 % SDS - PAGE gradient gel ( Invitrogen ) .
In - gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry : Lanes from the gel were excised , cut into 13 fields as shown in Figure S4B and digested overnight at 37 ° C with an excess of sequencing grade trypsin .
Peptides were extracted from the gel with 50 % acetonitrile / 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid and concentrated in a Speed - Vac .
Tryptic digests were analyzed with an automated nano LC - MS / MS system , consisting of an Agilent 1100 nano - LC system ( Agilent Technologies , Wilmington , DE ) coupled to an LTQ - Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , San Jose , CA ) equipped with a nanoflow ionization source ( James A . Hill Instrument Services , Arlington , MA ) .
Peptides were eluted from a 10 cm column ( Picofrit 75 μ m ID , New Objectives ) packed in - house with ReproSil - Pur C18 - AQ 3 μ m reversed phase resin ( Dr . Maisch , Ammerbuch Germany ) using a 90 min acetonitrile / 0.1 % formic acid gradient at a flow rate of 200 nl / min to yield ∼ 15 s peak widths .
The elution portion of LC gradient was 3 - 7 % solvent B in 2 min , 7 - 37 % in 58 min , 37 - 90 % in 3 min , and held at 90 % solvent B for 5 min .
Data - dependent LC - MS / MS spectra were acquired in ∼ 3 s cycles ; each cycle was of the following form : one full Orbitrap MS scan at 60,000 resolution followed by 8 MS / MS scans in the ion trap on the most abundant precursor ions using an isolation width of 3 m / z .
Dynamic exclusion was enabled with a mass width of ± 25 ppm , a repeat count of 1 , and an exclusion duration of 12 sec .
Charge state screening was enabled along with monoisotopic precursor selection to prevent triggering of MS / MS on precursor ions with unassigned charge or a charge state of 1 .
Normalized collision energy was set to 30 with an activation Q of 0.25 and activation time of 30 ms .
Protein identification , quantification , and phosphosite determination : All MS data was interpreted using the using the Spectrum Mill software package v 4.0 beta ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) .
Similar MS / MS spectra acquired on the same precursor m / z within ± 60 sec were merged , and poor quality MS / MS spectra which failed the quality filter of having a sequence tag length > 0 ( i.e. , minimum of two masses separated by the in - chain mass of an amino acid ) were excluded from searching .
MS / MS spectra were searched against the International Protein Index ( IPI ) mouse database version 3.48 .
Initial search parameters included : ESI linear ion trap scoring parameters , trypsin enzyme specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavages , 30 % minimum matched peak intensity , ± 20 ppm precursor mass tolerance , ± 0.7 Da product mass tolerance , and carbamidomethylation of cysteines as a fixed modification .
Allowed variable modifications were oxidized methionines , deamidation of asparagine , and pyro - glutamic acid modification at N - terminal glutamines with a precursor MH + shift range of − 18 to 65 Da .
Identities interpreted for individual spectra were automatically designated as valid by applying the scoring threshold criteria provided below to all spectra in a two - step process .
First , protein mode was used , which requires two or more matched peptides per protein while allowing a range of medium to excellent scores for each peptide .
Second , peptide mode was applied to the remaining spectra , allowing for excellent scoring peptides that are detected as the sole evidence for particular proteins .
Protein mode thresholds : protein score > 20 , peptide ( score , Scored Percent Intensity , delta rank 1 - rank 2 ) peptide charge + 2 : ( > 8 , > 65 % , > 2 ) peptide charge + 3 : ( > 9 , > 65 % , > 2 ) peptide charge + 4 : ( > 9 , > 70 % , > 2 ) peptide charge + 2 : ( > 6 , > 90 % , > 1 ) .
Peptide mode thresholds : peptide charge + 2 and + 3 ( > 13 , > 70 , > 2 ) peptide charge + 4 ( > 15 , > 70 , > 2 ) respectively .
The above criteria yielded a false discovery rate of < 1 % as estimated by target - decoy based searches using reversed sequences .
MS / MS spectra of phosphopeptides were interpreted in a second round of searches against only the subset of proteins confidently identified from the unphosphorylated peptides observed during the initial round of searches .
The allowed variable modifications were expanded to include phosphorylated serine , threonine , and tyrosine , with a precursor MH + shift range of − 18 to 177 Da ( no more than 2 phosphosites / peptide ) .
The spectrum of each phosphopeptide was manually inspected by an expert .
For ∼ 10 % of phosphosites observed the MS / MS spectra lack sufficient information to assign the site of phosphorylation to a particular Ser , Thr , or Tyr residue .
The relative abundances of proteins were determined using extracted ion chromatograms ( XICs ) for each peptide precursor ion in the intervening high resolution FT - MS scans of the LC - MS / MS runs .
An individual protein ' s abundance was calculated as the sum of the ion current measured for all quantifiable peptide precursor ions with MS / MS spectra confidently assigned to that protein .
Peptides were considered not quantifiable if they were shared across multiple subgroups of a protein or the precursor ions had a poorly defined isotope cluster ( i.e. the “ subgroup specific ” and “ exclude poor isotope quality precursor ” XIC filters in Spectrum Mill were enabled ) .
Proteins were considered not quantifiable if there were fewer than two distinct peptides observed in either the control or cKO samples .
Since equivalent amounts of total protein were loaded in each lane of the gel , and both samples were subsequently treated equivalently , no further normalization was done when calculating protein abundance ratios between the two samples .
The peak area for the XIC of each precursor ion subjected to MS / MS was calculated automatically by the Spectrum Mill software in the intervening high - resolution MS 1 scans of the LC - MS / MS runs using narrow windows around each individual member of the isotope cluster .
Peak widths in both the time and m / z domains were dynamically determined based on MS scan resolution , precursor charge , and m / z subject to quality metrics on the relative distribution of the peaks in the isotope cluster vs . theoretical .
Although the determined protein ratios are generally reliable to within a factor of two - fold of the actual ratio , numerous experimental factors contribute to variability in the determined abundance for a protein .
These factors may include incomplete digestion of the protein ; widely varying response of individual peptides due to inherent variability in ionization efficiency as well as interference / suppression by other components eluting at the same time as the peptide of interest , differences in instrument sensitivity over the mass range analyzed , and inadequate sampling of the chromatographic peak between MS / MS scans . mus AC 1 : cagcaggaaccaaggctaag ; tggccacattgactgtgttt mus AC 3 : tgaggagagcatcaacaacg ; tggtgtgactcctgaagctg mus AC 8 : ggactgtccccagagaaaca ; cttactcccgtgctgtccat mus pde1A : catgattgggttccatgttg ; cagccaactctttccacctc mus pde1b : tgcccttctctccactctgt ; tgggctgacttttaggcttg mus PDE2A : gaccgatggagatgatggac ; acttgtgggacaccttggtc mus PDE4D 1 : tatgaaggagcagccctcatg ; ccaggacatcttcctgctctg mus PDE4D 4 : tggccagtttctggtaggcctc ; gagctacccgtggtcgctac mus PDE4D 6 : ccaggacatcttcctgctctg ; cacattttagaacttgctgtcac mus PDE4D 7 : tggccagtttctggtaggcctc ; actactcaaaaccgcaccatgg mus PDE4B : ggaaaaatcccaggttggtt ; cagtccctgctcctctcatc
This is a longitudinal study of newly recruited participants in traditional and alternative interventions .
Participants were recruited in a two - stage cluster sampling frame .
Clustering units were community organizations working on food insecurity in the Montreal Metropolitan Region ( MMR ) .
The MMR includes 82 municipalities and a population of nearly four millions people [27] .
The list of organizations involved in food insecurity interventions was validated through the confirmation of experts with in - depth knowledge of the food insecurity intervention network in the Montreal area .
Organizations exclusively targeting children such as school lunch and breakfast programs were excluded .
A total of 451 organizations were selected .
We administered a phone survey to the directors of 30.1 % ( 136 / 451 ) of these organizations , randomly selected , to identify the interventions each organization implemented and the number of new and overall participants .
Of the 136 surveyed organizations , 61 uniquely offered traditional interventions and 75 offered a form of alternative intervention .
Organizations offering both traditional and alternative interventions were classified as alternative .
Participants selected from these organizations were uniquely participating in alternative interventions Organizations were invited to participate in our study based upon their number of new participants each year .
A minimum number of 30 and 50 participants having begun a food insecurity intervention in the past 6 months was set respectively for alternative and traditional interventions .
This criteria for participation was determined first , by considering what could be expected in terms of participant recruitment and second , what was needed in terms of statistical analysis .
Community partners ’ expertise first informed our criteria for the minimum number of new participants .
Namely , new participants in alternative interventions are less numerous than in traditional interventions whereas participation is stable and constant for longer periods of times .
While the number of new participants in traditional interventions is higher , participation is more sporadic and related to temporary situations .
Second , power calculations for the minimum number of participants required for statistical analysis , as further explained below , considered the hierarchical nature of the data .
Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age registered for the first time , and for less than 6 months in selected MMR food insecurity community organizations were invited to participate in our study .
People older than 65 years of age were excluded from the study because , in Quebec , they can benefit from income supplement and have preferential paths to fight food insecurity .
Homeless people were also excluded for two reasons .
First , homeless people represent a sub - population extremely vulnerable and their strategies to cope with food are different from the rest of the population [28] .
Second , their inclusion in the study would have biased results because of the lack of long term strategies for food insecurity directed to this vulnerable population .
Services and resources provided by organizations , although classified in the same category ( i.e. food bank ) could differ among organizations according to policies , quality of food or frequency of access .
Participants in our study were nested within organizations .
With nested data observations may not be independent and hierarchical multilevel modeling is recommended [29] .
To account for these differences along with the longitudinal nature of the data , analysis accounted for data structured into three levels .
The first level was the change overtime in dependent variables , the second level were individuals , the third corresponded to the organization where participants were recruited .
With this hierarchical structure of data , and since the intraclass ( among individuals ) and interclass ( among different organizations ) coefficients for our outcome variables were unknown , we needed a large number of participants in each organization to detect a 10 % difference in the variables measuring food security with an acceptable degree of precision ( 0.9 ) and at a statistically significant threshold ( 0.05 ) .
Among the 136 organizations , 16 organizations carrying out traditional interventions and 6 implementing alternative interventions met the criteria for a minimum number of new registered participants .
From October 2011 to May 2012 a questionnaire to investigate health , food insecurity and vulnerability was completed by participants with the support of research assistants specifically - trained to accompany participants through the completion of the questionnaire .
The questionnaire took approximately 30 - 45 minutes and was administered face to face in French or in English , according to the preference of participants .
Interviews took place in the organizations providing food insecurity interventions or in the nearby area .
Participants were informed that they would be called back and invited to participate in the second part of the study and were asked to inform the research team in case of changes of address .
Six months after the first interview , a postcard inviting participants to communicate possible changes of address was sent to each participant .
Nine months after the first interview , participants were invited by phone to complete the follow up interview .
A nine month follow - up was considered adequate to detect intervention effects on the level of food security and health status because according to community partners , sufficient time has passed such that participation in alternative food security interventions has become regular .
Non respondents were contacted by mail and invited to contact project managers .
The second interview took place in the same location as the first .
In case of changes of address or impracticability of the first location , another place was chosen by mutual agreement .
The same questionnaire was used for the first and the second survey .
The categorizing variable corresponded to participants ’ enrollment in one of the two intervention strategies , traditional or alternative .
Dependent variables were food security status and perceived physical and mental health .
Control variables considered in the study were gender , age , country of birth , marital status and income .
Food security status was measured using the food security module included in the Canadian Community Health Survey ( CCHS ) [30] .
The food security module presents the same questions used in the United States Household Food Security Survey Module ( HFSSM ) .
The HFSSM was validated to measure change in food security status overtime [31] .
The CCHS calculates three scores of food insecurity for the previous year : for the respondent , for dependent children ( when applicable ) and for the respondent ’ s household .
The CCHS food security module is composed of 10 adult - related and 8 children - related questions investigating whether the respondent or other household members experienced indicators of food insecurity .
Questions query the severity of the experiences associated with food , such as an anxiety that food will run out , a need to modify the amount of food consumed , experiencing hunger , and in the extreme , going a whole day without eating .
Each multiple choice answer is recoded scoring 0 or 1 point , where 0 corresponds to food security and 1 to food insecurity status .
For example , if the question “ You and other household members worried that food would run out before you got money to buy more . Was that often true , sometimes true , or never true in the past 12 months ? ”
was answered “ never true ” the question was coded as 0 while responses of “ often true ” or “ sometimes true ” were coded 1 .
The answers “ often ” and “ sometimes ” are both considered affirmative responses because they indicate that the condition occurred at some time during the year [31] .
The final score ranges between 0 to 10 for adults and 0 to 8 for children .
The food security module defines three levels of food security : food security , with scores of 0 or 1 , moderate insecurity with a score between 2 and 5 for adults and 2 and 4 for children , and severe insecurity with score respectively above 5 for adults and above 4 for children .
Household food security status is dependent on both adult and child scores .
In families with children , the household is food secure if both adults and children are food secure ; the household is moderately food insecure if either adults or children are moderately food insecure but neither is severely food insecure ; the household is severely food insecure if either adults or children are severely food insecure .
In childless households , adults ’ food security status corresponds to household food security status .
Health related quality of life : Generic health - related quality of life was measured using the SF - 12 - v 2 questionnaire [32] .
The SF - 12 - v 2 is a shorter and validated version of SF - 36 , regularly used to assess perceived health [33] .
The questionnaire tests physical and mental health in the last four weeks generating 8 subscales : 1 - physical functioning ( composed of 2 items : health limitations in accomplishing moderate activities such as moving a table , or pushing a vacuum cleaner ; health limitations in climbing several flights of stairs ) ; 2 - role limitations due to physical problems ( composed of 2 items : limitations accomplishing what one desires to accomplish ; limitations in the kind of work or activities ) ; 3 - bodily pain ( composed of 1 item : pain interference in the accomplishment of normal work ) ; 4 - general health perceptions ( composed of 1 item : own health perception ) ; 5 - vitality ( composed of 1 item : perceived energy ) ; 6 - social functioning ( composed of 1 item : interference of physical health or emotional problems ) ; 7 - role limitations due to emotional problems ( composed of 2 items : limitations in accomplishing what wanted as a result of feeling depressed or anxious ; less attention in doing work or other activities ) ; and 8 - mental health ( composed of 2 items : perception of calm and peace ; perception of downhearted and depression ) .
Based on these subscales , two summary scores were calculated : the physical ( PCS ) and the mental ( MCS ) component summary scores .
PCS was built with the subscales 1 through 4 and MCS was built with subscales 5 through 8.PCS and MCS scores were transformed in a 0 - 100 score according to published regression weights and scoring rules ( a higher score indicating better health - related quality of life ) as suggested in the user manual [34] .
Household income and other control variables : Respondent ’ s gender , age , country of birth , being part of a visible minority , marital status and household income were self - reported .
According to the Employment Equity Act of Canada , we defined visible minorities " persons , other than Aboriginal peoples , who are non - Caucasian in race or non - white in colour " . Household income was grouped into 7 categories ranging from “ no income ” to “ income superior to $ 40000 ” .
In our analysis , missing values were not imputed but excluded pair - wise .
Since our data were repeated measures from individuals nested in organizations and categorized in two different interventions , the influence of dependent variables on the outcomes ( food insecurity and health ) was investigated with multilevel regression analyses .
We used multilevel models to account for the hierarchical structure of data and likewise , to avoid an underestimation of the group effect and incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference ( i.e. type I error ) [29] .
The analyses were executed separately for participants in traditional and alternative interventions .
Generalized linear latent regression models ( GLLAMM ) were used .
GLLAMM performs maximum likelihood estimation by using adaptive quadrature .
Three - level random intercept regression models were constructed for food security for each intervention strategy .
A first model was constructed using food insecurity as the dependent variable .
Subsequently , a sequence of controlling variables ( respondent ’ s gender , age , country of birth , marital status and income ) were entered as covariates at the individual level of the model .
No organization level factors were added to the models .
Six linear random intercept regression GLLAMM models were used to assess perceived health ( three for physical health and three for mental health ) in each intervention group .
The first two models considered physical and mental health unadjusted , the following two models were adjusted for respondents ’ gender , age , country of birth , marital status and income , while the last two models were also adjusted for adults ’ food security status .
Differences across time in the two intervention groups were also tested through GLAMM models .
The STATA v 11.2 software was used to perform statistical analysis .
This study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects / patients were approved by the health research ethics committee ( CERES ) of the University of Montreal .
Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects / patients .
This study was under the research project “ A study of interactions between cognition , emotion and physiology ( Protocol No : 100 - 014 - E ) , ” which was approved by the Institution Review Board ( IRB ) of the National Taiwan University Hospital Hsinchu Branch .
Written Informed consents were obtained from all subjects before the experiment .
Fifty - two subjects ranging in age between 20 and 26 ( M = 21.3 , SD = 1.2 ; 44 men , 8 women ) performed keyboard typing tasks right after presented with emotional stimuli .
The subjects were college students selected from a university in Taiwan , with normal hearing in regard to relative sensitivity at different frequencies .
All the subjects self - reported that they were nonsmoker , healthy , with no history of brain injury and cardiovascular problems .
The subjects also reported that they had normal or corrected - to - normal vision and normal range of finger movement .
They are all right - handed .
A subject wore earphones during the experiment and was instructed to type - in a target typing text " 748596132 " once immediately after hearing each of the International Affective Digitized Sounds 2nd edition ( IADS - 2 ) [42] sounds , for 63 trials .
The experiment was conducted based on a simple dimensional view of emotion , which assumes that emotion can be defined by a coincidence of values on two different strategic dimensions that are , valence and arousal .
To assess these two dimensions of the affective space , the Self - Assessment Manikin ( SAM ) , an affective rating system devised by Lang [43] was used to acquire the affective ratings .
Each trial began with an instruction ( “ Please type - in the target typing text after listening to the next sound ” ) presented for 5 s .
Then , the sound stimulus was presented for 6 s .
After the sound terminated , the SAM with a rating instruction ( “ Please rate your feeling on both the two dimensions after typing the target typing text ‘ 748596132 ’ ” ) was presented .
The subject first typed - in the target typing text once , and then made his / her ratings of valence and arousal .
A standard 15 s rating period was used , which allows ample time for the subject to make the SAM ratings .
A computer program controlled the presentation and timing of the instructions and sounds .
The keystroke data was recorded during the typing task .
In addition to the 63 trials , 3 practice trials and a training section were applied prior to the experiment .
Three sounds ( birds , female sigh , and baby cry ) provided the subject with a rough range of the types of the contents that were presented .
After these practice trials was the training section , in which the subject continually typed - in the target typing text ( presented on the screen by blue text and gray background ) using the number pad ( shown in Fig 1 ( a ) ) that is located on the right side of a standard keyboard , for 40 s .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0129056.g001 The number pad in the keyboard used in our experiment , with an illustration of the design concept of our designed target number typing sequence .
The arrow shows the order of changes of the typing target .
For those ( x , y ) pairs in the heptagons , x represents the order of a typing target and y represents the desirable finger ( i.e. thumb ( f1 ) , index finger ( f2 ) , middle finger ( f3 ) , ring finger ( f4 ) , and little finger ( f5 ) or pinky ) that was used for typing the corresponding typing target .
A number sequence was used as the target typing text instead of an alphabet sequence or symbols to avoid possible interference caused by linguistic context to the subject ’ s emotional states .
In all the various number sequences used in our pilot experiments [ 38 , 44 ] , we found the existence of the difference in keystroke typing between the subjects in different emotional states .
However , we also found that the relationship between the keystroke typing and emotional states may be different due to different keys that are typed and also the order of typing .
A comparison of keystroke typing between emotional states using different number sequences may reduce the power of statistical tests ( given a same number of trials ) .
Hence , to conduct a more conservative comparison across emotion and to enhance the generalizability of this study , we decided to use a single number sequence that is designed to be general .
We designed the target typing text “ 748596132 ” to 1 ) be easy to type without requiring the subjects to perform abrupt changes in their posture , 2 ) have the number of digits fairly distributed on a number pad , and 3 ) encourage all the subjects to maintain a same posture ( i.e. , in terms of finger usage ) when typing the given sequence [38] ( see Fig 1 ( b ) for more detail ) .
The time length of the experiment was designed to be as short as possible to avoid the subjects from being tired of typing on the keyboard .
Note that all the subjects indeed reported that they were not fatigued after the experiment .
The stimuli we used were 63 sounds selected from the IADS - 2 database , which is developed and distributed by the NIMH Center for Emotion and Attention ( CSEA ) at the University of Florida [42] .
The IADS - 2 is developed to provide a set of normative emotional stimuli for experimental investigations of emotion and attention and can be easily obtained through e - mail application .
The IADS - 2 database contains various affective sounds proved to be capable of inducing diverse emotions in the affective space [45] .
The sounds we used as the stimuli were selected from IADS - 2 database complying the IADS - 2 sound set selection protocol described in [42] .
The protocol includes the constraint about the number of sounds used in a single experiment , and the distribution of the emotions that are expected to be induced by the selected sounds .
Two different stimulus orders were used to balance the position of a particular stimulus within the series across the subjects .
The physical properties of these sounds were also controlled to prevent clipping , and to control for loudness [42] .
The SAM is a non - verbal pictorial assessment designed to assess the emotional dimensions ( i.e. valence and arousal ) directly by means of two sets of graphical manikins .
The SAM has been extensively tested in conjunction with the IADS - 2 and has been used in diverse theoretical studies and applications [46-48] .
The SAM takes a very short time to complete ( 5 to 10 seconds ) .
For using the SAM , there is little chance of confusion with terms as in verbal assessments .
The SAM was also reported to be capable of indexing cross - cultural results [49] and the results obtained using Semantic Differential scale ( the verbal scale provided in [50] ) .
The SAM that we used was identical to the 9 - point rating scale version of SAM that was used in [42] , in which the SAM ranges from a smiling , happy figure to a frowning , unhappy figure when representing the affective valence dimension .
On the other hand , for the arousal dimension , the SAM ranges from an excited , wide - eyed figure to a relaxed , sleepy figure .
The SAM ratings in the current study were scored such that 9 represented a high rating on each dimension ( i.e. positive valence , high arousal ) , and 1 represented a low rating on each dimension ( i.e. negative valence , low arousal ) .
During the experiment , a subject wore earphones ( Sennheiser PC 160SK Stereo Headset ) and sat on an office chair ( 0.50 x 0.51 m , height 0.43 m ) , in a small , quiet office ( 7.6 x 3.2 m ) without people .
The office was with window and the ventilation was guaranteed .
The computer system ( acer Veriton M2610 , processor : Intel Core i3 - 2120 3.3G / 3M / 65W , memory : 4GB DDR 3 - 1066 , operating system : Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64bit ) used by the subject was put under a desk ( 0.70 x 1.26 m , height 0.73 m ) .
The subject was seated approximately 0.66 m from the computer screen ( ViewSonic VE 700 , 17 inch , 1280 x 1024 in resolution ) .
The keyboard used by the subject was an acer KU - 0355 ( 18.2 x 45.6 cm , normal keyboard with the United States layout , typically used for Windows operating system ) connected to the computer system used through USB 2.0 communication interface .
The distance between the center of adjacent keys ( size : 1.2 x 1.2 cm ) of the number pad used was 2 cm .
Keyboard lifts ( the two small supports at the back of the keyboard ) which raise the back of the keyboard for 0.8 cm when used , were not used in this experiment .
The subject was sat approximately 0.52 m from the center of the number pad ( i.e. the digit “ 5 ” of the number pad ) .
The keystroke collection software was developed using C # project built by using Visual Studio 2008 and was executed on the .
NET framework ( version 3.5 ) platform .
The reason of using C # programming language in developing this software was that the language provides more sufficient Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs ) for utilizing the function of keystroke - interrupt detection in Microsoft Windows operation systems than other programming languages such as R , Matlab , Java , and Python .
In total , 63 ( trials ) x 52 ( subjects ) = 3,276 rows of the raw data were collected during the experiment .
However , 117 ( 3.6 % of the 3276 samples ) rows of the raw data were excluded because the SAM rating was not completed .
In our analysis , a sequence typed is a " correctly typed sequence " if the target typing text was correctly typed and “ incorrectly typed sequence ” if incorrectly typed .
For instance , if a subject typed “ 7485961342 ” , of which the “ 4 ” at the 9th digit is misplaced , the sequence typed was considered as an incorrectly typed sequence .
A pre - processing routine was applied to the raw data to separate all the correctly typed sequences from incorrectly typed sequences .
Keystroke duration and keystroke latency features were only extracted from the correctly typed sequences ( 91.2 % of the 3,024 samples ) .
The keystroke duration is the time that elapsed from the key press to the key release , whereas the keystroke latency is the time that elapsed from one key release to the next key press [51] .
The extracted keystroke duration and keystroke latency features were submitted to two two - way 3 ( Valence : negative , neutral , and positive ) x 3 ( Arousal : low , medium , and high ) Repeat Measures ANOVAs [52] , respectively .
To analyze the accuracy rate of keyboard typing , the accuracy data ( 0 for incorrectly typed sequence and 1 for correctly typed sequence ) of all the typed sequences was submitted to a two - way 3 ( Valence : negative , neutral , and positive ) x 3 ( Arousal : low , medium , and high ) Repeat Measures ANOVA .
Post - hoc analysis was conducted using multiple t - tests with Bonferroni correction .
The 9 - point scale SAM ratings of the valence and arousal were translated into three levels of the ANOVA factor Valence and Arousal .
Eleven subjects were excluded from the application of the Repeat Measures ANOVA ( leaving 2,583 rows of the raw data ) because of having numerous empty cells .
These subjects reported a small range of changes in SAM ratings ( i.e. unsuccessful emotion elicitation ) throughout the experiment , which leaded to empty cells .
Specifically , we removed these 11 subjects that contain over 3 empty cells ( missing values ) in a 3 ( Valence : negative , neutral , and positive ) x 3 ( Arousal : low , medium , and high ) table .
The decision of not to impute them was because of that the research objectives of the current study were to examine the keystroke dynamics in the 3 x 3 emotional conditions , of which the multiple imputations may lead to unreliable results .
Notably , the 11 subjects that were removed from the analysis contain 6 , 6 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 3 , and 3 empty cells .
The ANOVA results of the dataset that included these subjects by imputing all the missing values by using average values are also presented in the result section , next to the ANOVA result of the dataset that with these subjects excluded .
The significance level α of the entire statistical hypothesis tests used in this paper was set to 0.05 .
Thirty - two right - handed undergraduate psychology students ( gender : 21 female , 11 male ; age : M = 23.3 years , SD = 4.7 ) took part in our study in exchange for course credit points .
All participants gave written informed consent and could decide to discontinue participation at any time .
The research design was approved by the Ethics Committee of the German Psychological Society and performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki .
Each participant played the following card game with the computer .
First , the participant sees a screen with ten cards face down and receives the information that each card has a number from 1 to 10 and each number exists only once .
Then , the participant draws one card .
While choosing a card , an arrow in the middle of the screen indicates whether the higher or the lower card wins .
Once the participant has chosen a card , that card is immediately turned over .
Finally , a computer - drawn card from the remaining nine follows 7 s later ( Fig . 1 ) .
While winning has no consequences , losing leads to an electric shock with a 50 % probability .
This design is related to Preuschoff et al . [19] .
We modified the general procedure with respect to two different aspects .
Firstly , instead of betting on a higher or lower second card with both cards drawn by the computer , our participants choose the first card out of ten themselves under a given bet .
This modification was made to keep motivation levels sufficiently high by giving participants more freedom and the option to develop hypotheses about any existent general rules ( which did not exist ) .
Secondly , instead of losing or winning money , participants received electric shocks if they lost a bet .
The idea of giving a shock only in some of the lost cases is due to a general habituation effect .
As we work on the fear of electric shock rather than on the shock itself , we decided that the shock would be given with a 50 % probability .
The type of the bet changes in each round .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0120989.g001 Experimental design .
This approach , which excludes any form of active decision - making processes in the period after the first card , enables us to analyze pure sensitivity towards the likelihood of unpleasant events which is not contaminated by active decision - making processes .
Showing the first card implicitly reveals the probability of receiving an electric shock associated with this card .
After revealing the first card , we measure SCRs until the second card is turned over .
In order to ensure that participants pay attention , we subsequently ask them to indicate whether they won or lost the bet .
Incorrect answers were also followed by an electric shock .
The software package Psychtoolbox - 3 ( www.psychtoolbox.org ) running on MATLAB 7.1 ( MathWorks Inc . , United States ) was used for stimulus presentation and response acquisition .
Participants were firstly instructed in written form and then verbally .
In addition , each participant performed a practice run of 2 rounds without electric stimulation , in order to understand the task instructions .
Afterwards , each participant played a total of 60 rounds with electric stimulation .
In order to cover the full range of possible cases , the sequence of the first cards was arranged in a way that allowed each possible outcome ( combination of the bet type and the first card ) to occur exactly six times in one session .
The order of this sequence and the value of the second card were random .
The average duration of each session was 45 minutes ( min ) .
Pain was delivered via electric stimulation with a Canicom 800 ( Num ’ Axes , France ) ( Levels of stimulation : 15 ; frequency : 1.023 Hz ; duration : 115 ms , power range : 0.5 to 206 mW ) .
The stimulation was administered via two flat AG - AGCL electrodes of 10 mm diameter being placed at the medial phalanges of the digits II and III of the dominant hand .
Individual levels of pain stimulation were calibrated using a standard procedure : Shocks were presented in an ascending series of intensity until the participant indicated that the shock was painful .
Once a painful level was reached , the previous stimulation level was used during the experiment .
We used a 16 - channel bioamplifier ( Nexus - 16 ; Mind Media B.V . , the Netherlands ) and the corresponding recording software Biotrace ( Mind Media B.V . ) to record electrodermal responses .
Unfiltered SC data were acquired using a customer - specific SC sensor .
The sensor maintained a voltage of less than 0.8V between the two flat AG - AGCL 10 mm diameter electrodes , which were placed at the medial phalanges of the digits II and III of the non - dominant hand .
In accordance with common recomendations [20] , the electrode sites were prepared with an isotonic paste ( TD - 246 , Discount Disposables ) and there was a 5 min pause between attaching the electrodes and starting recording .
SC data were sampled at 32 Hz .
Skin conductance data was analyzed using Ledalab ( www.ledalab.de ) applying continuous decomposition analysis to disentangle phasic components from tonic activity [21] .
The integrated skin conductance response ( ISCR ) , which is defined as the time integral of the phasic driver for a relevant time interval , was used as a measure for the phasic electrodermal response to a given stimulus .
In order to account for the typical skewed distribution of magnitude of electrodermal responses , individual ISCRs were standardized by the formula : ISCR = log ( 1 + ∣ ISCR ∣ ) × sign ( ISCR ) [22] , [23] .
ISCRs for the time interval of 1 - 3 s after flipping the second card were used to analyze the effect of pain stimulation .
The delay in SCRs has been reported in the literature [24] .
In order to measure sensitivity towards the likelihood of receiving an electric shock , ISCRs were computed for the 5 s window starting 2 s after turning the first card .
We skip the first two seconds in order to discard the effect of motor activation due to card selection ( compare Fig . 2 ) .

Shaded areas indicate the within - participant standard errors of the mean .
For ANOVA analyses , degrees of freedom were corrected by means of the Greenhouse - Geisser method were necessary and Bonferroni post - hoc tests were used for pair - wise comparisons of means .
A total of eight cancers ( hepatocellular carcinoma , thyroid cancer , colorectal cancer , gastric cancer , lung cancer , prostate cancer , breast cancer , and cervical cancer ) were included in the present study .
We used data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry ( KCCR ) of the National Cancer Center Korea .
More than 190 hospitals participate in the KCCR , and data regarding over 90 % of newly diagnosed cancers in Korea are collected [17] .
The KCCR offers annual national cancer incidence , survival , and prevalence data , and the KCCR database includes information regarding patients with cancer , such as sex , age , and date of diagnosis [4] .
From the KCCR , we obtained the number of cancer patients by sex , age , and severity level from 2006 to 2013 , as well as follow - up data for mortality for up to eight years .
Furthermore , we utilized mid - year population data based on resident registration from the Korean Statistical Information Service of Statistics Korea to calculate incidence rates and prevalence rates [18] .
The severity level was classified by SEER stage as follows : localized stage , regional stage , distant stage , and unknown stage .
The SEER stage was based on the time of diagnosis .
First , we described the number of incident cancer cases according to sex and SEER stage from 2006 to 2013 .
The incidence rates by sex and SEER stage were determined as the number of incident cancer cases by sex and SEER stage divided by the mid - year population by sex .
The means of incidence rates and their 95 % confidence intervals from 2006 to 2013 according to Poisson distribution assumption were estimated by type of cancer , sex , and SEER stage .
Furthermore , we conducted statistical tests for linear trend of overall incidence rates and proportions of incidence rates by stage .
Patients with cancer identified in 2006 underwent follow - up for all - cause mortality and observed survival rates by sex and SEER stage .
All - cause mortality and observed survival rates by sex and SEER stage in each follow - up year were calculated as the number of patients with cancer alive by sex and SEER stage in each follow - up year divided by the total number of patients with cancer by sex and SEER stage in 2006 .
Finally , we estimated the prevalence rates for eight cancers by sex and SEER stage in 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 .
Fig 1 shows the method of estimating the number of prevalent cases .
We assumed that patients with cancer who lived more than five years past their diagnosis were recovered from the cancer , and these patients were excluded from the prevalent cases .
For example , prevalent cases in 2013 included the patients with cancer who were diagnosed in 2013 , as well as patients with cancer who were diagnosed since 2009 and still alive ( Fig 1 ) .
As with incidence rates , the 5 - year prevalence rates by sex and SEER stage were calculated as the number of prevalent cases by sex and SEER stage divided by the mid - year population by sex .

In the case of breast cancer , we only analyzed the female patients , because male patients account for a small proportion of the total patients with breast cancer .
For a similar reason , all analyses were restricted to individuals aged ≥ 30 years .
In particular , in the case of prostate cancer , only individuals aged ≥ 50 were included in the analyses , because prostate cancer patients under age 50 are rare in Korea .
We used Microsoft Office Excel 2010 and Stata software ( Stata / SE 13.1 ) for all analyses .
In this study , P - values less than 0.05 were regarded statistically significant .
Ethical approval and consent to participate were unnecessary because we used publicly available data without any personal identifiers .
Methods to Estimate Demand for Industrial and Commercial Land : The objective of this study is to develop and validate approaches to estimate demand for industrial and commercial land .
The approaches should be relatively straightforward so that they can be easily replicable and applicable to large spatial regions ( e.g. countries and continents ) in the context of land use modelling .
We propose to explore in particular those approaches based on land use intensity measures .
The main reason for this choice relies on the fact that , as reviewed in the previous section , these measures are not especially intensive to calculate , requiring only a few aggregate variables , characteristics which become relevant when working at very large spatial extents .
Still , intensity measures are informative and conceptually easy to interpret .
Moreover , they link to sector - specific processes of economic development that are expected to be relevant for the land uptake of industrial and commercial use .
Using intensities allows linking land use simulations to regional economic projections .
Below in this section , several variants of the land use intensity approach are formally introduced .
By definition , intensity measures integrate one driver of land use change at a time .
In this study , sector gross value added ( GVA ) is used as a proxy for sector economic output .
In addition to the land use intensity approaches , trend extrapolations are also tested .
Trend extrapolations can be seen as the simplest way to make estimations because they do not specifically address drivers of land use change , but rather apply observed growth trends to describe possible future conditions .
The main reason to consider trend extrapolations in this study is to create an adequate term of comparison for the estimations based on intensity measures .
Once introduced , the models will be applied to estimate the demand for industrial and commercial land for a set of countries in Europe .
Trend extrapolation ( models 1 & 2 ) : Two trend extrapolation methods are considered : a linear extrapolation ( model 1 ) and an exponential extrapolation ( model 2 ) .
The linear extrapolation is formulated in equation 3 : ( 3 ) where A refers to the industrial and commercial area , t0 and t1 correspond to the starting and ending years of the calibration , respectively , and ε is the error term .
In this method , the average yearly absolute growth of the calibration period ( t0 to t1 ) is multiplied by the total forecasting years ( t2 - t1 ) to obtain the estimate for desired year t2 .
In the exponential extrapolation , the average yearly growth rate G observed between t0 and t1 is firstly obtained through equation 4 , and it is then applied to estimate the industrial and commercial land in t2 ( equation 5 ) .
The graph in Figure 1 shows the application of both models to a hypothetical region with 200 ha of industrial and commercial land in 1990 , and 300 ha in 2000 .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0091991.g001 Extrapolation models for hypothetical region with 200 and 300 hectares of industrial and commercial land in 1990 and 2000 . ( 4 )
( 5 ) Region specific land use intensity ( models 3 & 4 ) : The economic product and surface area of commercial and industrial uses are consistently highly correlated at the regional level .
If we take the sum of the regional gross value added of the industrial , commercial and service sectors and relate it to the respective surface area as reported by the CORINE Land Cover ( CLC ) datasets , correlation coefficients ranging between 0.74 and 0.76 can be found for the years 1990 , 2000 and 2006 , in Europe .
This suggests that , in general , the higher the economic product of a region , the more physical infrastructure is required to support the economic activity .
Models 3 and 4 are characterized by using economic output or product P of regions as the driver of development of industrial and commercial areas .
In both models , a land use intensity approach is used to relate the economic product with the respective area of industrial and commercial units .
In model 3 , the land use intensity LUI is computed for the year t1 and measured as economic output per hectare of industrial and commercial land ( eq . 6 ) .
Then , assuming a stable land use intensity in time , and knowing the product P for t2 , the total industrial and commercial land is predicted ( eq . 7 ) . ( 6 )
( 7 ) This model takes the whole regional product and the whole existing area of industry and commerce per region in t1 to compute the land use intensity .
However , the total amount of industrial land is strongly related to historic developments and only partly dependent on current economic performance .
In fact , as existing industrial and commercial land is likely to remain ( with or without actual economic activity ) , this inertia is not captured by a single and static snapshot of the land use intensity .
So we should perhaps focus especially on changes in economic development and related changes in the amount of land needed .
This implies that the land use intensity of new developments is important in order to capture shifts in the production structure .
Model 4 builds upon this idea .
It measures land use intensity only of the industrial and commercial land developed during the calibration period t0 and t1 ( eq . 8 ) .
The ‘ land use intensity of the recently developed land ’ is then used to estimate the extra land related to the growth of the product in the subsequent period ( t1 : t2 ) ( eq . 8 ) .
Contrary to the model 3 , this approach ignores the land use intensity of the industrial and commercial land developed prior to t0 . ( 8 )
( 9 ) We call these approaches ‘ region specific ’ because the intensity measures described above can be computed separately for any set of regions composing the whole of any area of interest .
Consequently , regional differences in land use intensity ( which are underpinned by differences in productivity and production structure ) are captured .
Region and sector specific land use intensity ( models 5 & 6 ) : Industrial and commercial land is a rather broad and heterogeneous land use class .
For example , in the CORINE Land Cover nomenclature , the homonymous land use class includes factories of all different kinds of industries , facilities for energy production and telecommunication networks , facilities related to defence and security , shopping malls and exposition sites , and a wide range of facilities related to public or private services likes schools , university and research campuses and hospitals [41] .
Trying to model such a heterogeneous class as a whole poses obvious limitations .
Most obvious of all , land use intensities vary considerably among industries [28] , [30] , [31] , let alone the differences between the various economic sectors .
To address this limitation , one could think of making the land use intensity measures both region and sector specific .
In this case , the economic product of a given sector s would be related to the land area A known to be used by sector s in year t1 ( eq . 10 ) .
At this point , it would be possible to estimate the aggregated industrial and commercial land for a given t2 ( eq . 11 ) .
Conceptually , this formulation is more robust than models 3 and 4 because it allows the integration of land use intensities specific to n number of sectors ( model 5 ) .
In addition , a factor ω could be used to transform the land use intensities when calculating A in t2 , as a function of the observed changes in LUI between t0 and t1 , that is ω s = f ( Δ LUIs , t0 , t1 ) .
In this study , we let ω = 1 for all sectors . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) This model can be also combined with the concept of ‘ land use intensity of the recently developed land ’ , as introduced in model 4 .
This is done by applying equations 12 and 13 ( model 6 ) : ( 12 ) ( 13 )
The murine fibroblastic cell line L929 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ; Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco ) , 1 % ( v / v ) glutamine ( Gibco ) and 1 % ( v / v ) penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco ) .
The prostate cancer cell line PC - 3 , colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD - 1 , and large cell lung carcinoma cell line NCI - H460 were obtained from China Center for Type Culture Collection ( CCTCC ) , and cultured in RPMI - 1640 at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 with 95 % humidity .
Reovirus type 3 Dearing strain was obtained from ATCC ( VR - 824 ) and stored in - 80 ° C until use .
Reovirus was propagated in L929 cells , titrated by a standard plaque assay .
For generation of UV - inactivated reovirus , reovirus in PBS were exposed to UV light ( shortwave 254nm ) for 30 minutes .
The UV - induced loss of reoviral replicability was confirmed with L929 cell viability assay .
To assess junctional adhesion molecule - A ( JAM - A ) expression , cells were stained with FITC - conjugated anti - JAM - A mAb ( clone 1H 2A 9 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) .
In experiments evaluating reovirus to CIK cell attachment , reovirus treated CIK cells were incubated with anti - reovirus - σ 3 primary antibody ( 1 : 100 , 4F 2 ; DSHB , University of Iowa , Department of Biology , Iowa City , IA , USA ) at 4 ° C overnight .
This was followed by incubation with FITC - goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 100 , Jackson ImmunoResearch , Inc . ) secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 ° C .
The cells were subsequently washed and stained with APC - conjugated mouse - anti - human CD 3 ( SK 7 ) , PE - conjugated mouse - anti - human CD 8 ( RPA - T8 ) or PE - conjugated mouse - anti - human CD 56 ( MY 31 ) antibodies , respectively .
Appropriate FITC , PE , or APC isotype control antibodies were used as negative controls ; all antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences , and used according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions .
Stained cells were analyzed on a FC 500 flow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter ) , with data analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR , USA ) .
Generation of CIK cells and loading with reovirus : The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guizhou Medical University , and all participants provided written informed consent .
PBMCs were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy donors , by density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll - Hypaque ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ; Milan , Italy ) .
CIK cells were generated from PBMCs as previously described [19] .
Briefly , PBMCs were cultured in GT - T551 medium ( Takara Bio Inc . ) containing 1000 U / ml human interferon γ ( PeproTech ) for 24 hours .
PBMCs were then stimulated with 100 ng / ml anti - CD 3 antibody ( R&D ) and 500 U / ml rHuIL - 2 ( PeproTech ) .
Fresh medium containing 500 U / ml rHuIL - 2 was added every 3 days .
To assess CIK cell quality , aliquots of cells were harvested after 14 - 16 days of incubation , and characterized by phenotypic analysis and cytotoxicity assay .
The major effector cells were NKT ( CD 3 + CD 56 + NKT ≥ 20 % ) and CTL cells ( CD 3 + CD 8 + CTL ≥ 60 % ) .
To establish the optimal reovirus loading condition , CIK cells were infected with reovirus of 1 plaque forming units ( pfu ) / cell at both 4 ° C or 37 ° C for 2 or 4 hours , respectively .
CIK cells were then washed with PBS to remove unbound viruses , and reovirus binding on CIK cells was assessed by flow cytometry .
Optimal reovirus loading occurred at an MOI of 1 at 4 ° C for 2 hours , and this condition was used in subsequent experiments .
To determine reovirus - mediated cell lysis , tumor cell lines ( DLD - 1 , PC - 3 , and NCI - H460 ) and CIK cells were seeded in 96 - well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well in 100 μ l medium and incubated overnight .
After 12 hours , cells were treated with reovirus in the amounts of 0 , 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 and 1 pfu / cell .
After 2 hours of incubation , cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound viruses , and fresh growth medium was added .
Cell viability was measured with Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 , Dojindo Lab , Tokyo , Japan ) following the manufacturer ' s instructions , and calculated as percentage of viable cells in the reovirus - treated group versus untreated controls .
Total RNA was extracted from DLD - 1 , PC - 3 , NCI - H460 , and CIK cells at 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after infection with 1pfu / cell reovirus , respectively , with TRIZOL reagent ( Invitrogen ) .
First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) with 0.5 μ g total RNA per 10 μ l reaction .
Gene expression was quantified by real - time quantitative RT - PCR with iQSYBR Green supermix ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) ; detection was performed by measuring the binding of the fluorescence dye SYBR Green I to double - stranded DNA .
The primer sets were provided by Generay Biotechnology ( see Table 1 ) .
The comparative Ct method was used for data analysis .
Relative quantity was defined as 2 − Δ Δ Ct , with β - actin used as the reference gene .

This study has been registered in PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic review ( CRD 42018097473 ) .
The inclusion criteria were based on the PICOS framework : ( i ) population : female breast cancer patients ; ( ii ) intervention : any form of clinical treatment interventions ; ( iii ) comparator : not restricted ; ( iv ) outcome : direct medical treatment costs ( inpatient and outpatient ) by stage incurred in hospital settings at the patient level ; and ( v ) study design : costing studies with primary data .
We excluded studies with the following characteristics : ( i ) no treatment cost estimates by stage ; ( ii ) treatment costs not incurred in hospital settings which cannot reflect direct medical costs ( inpatient and outpatient ) ; ( iii ) costs not estimated from actual patient level data , but calculated according to treatment pathways in clinical guidelines ; ( iv ) disease stages categorised neither as 0 , I , II , III and IV in the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics ( FIGO ) staging system , nor as in situ , local , regional and distant cancer ; and ( v ) review articles .
Only studies that had primary data on the breast cancer costs were selected to avoid repeating previously published information .
There was no language limit for the eligibility criteria .
We searched MEDLINE ( R ) ( 1946 to April Week 4 2018 ) , EMBASE Classic + EMBASE ( 1947 to 30 April 2018 ) , and NHS Economic Evaluation Database ( NHS EED , 1960 to April 2018 ) with search terms in S1 Table .
Also , reference lists from relevant primary studies and review articles were used to identify other relevant publications .
Titles and abstracts were first reviewed , and full - texts of the studies that potentially met the eligibility criteria were retrieved and full - text reviewed .
Two investigators independently extracted the study characteristics and treatment costs of breast cancer by stage at diagnosis .
Most studies conducted cost analyses up to a specified time rather than over a lifetime horizon .
Although some studies reported the annual costs , we extracted the cumulative costs during the pre - specified time horizons for comparative purposes .
We first summarised the cumulative treatment costs of breast cancer patients by stage in all reviewed studies .
Then we compared the costs in studies with the same pre - specified time horizons .
We used US dollars with the base year of 2015 to facilitate the comparison of costs .
In this study , we used purchasing power parity ( PPP ) conversion factor to convert cost estimates reported in different currencies to US dollars , and used the consumer price index ( CPI ) for health care to convert cost estimates reported at different time points to the same year .
PPP is the rate of currency conversion at which a given amount of currency will purchase the same volume of goods and services in two countries .
CPI is a measure that examines the changes in the price level of a basket of consumer goods and services .
Critical appraisal and methodological assessment : Two investigators used an established checklist by Drummond et al . [9] to assess the quality of reviewed studies independently .
Items not applicable to costing studies were removed .
A three - point response scale was added to better grade the quality of each item on the checklist , ranging from 0 ( not considered ) , through 1 ( partially considered ) , to 2 ( fully considered ) [10] .
We summed up all scores and compared this with the maximum attainable score to calculate the percentage of the maximum attainable score .
In addition , we conducted a more detailed analysis of the methods used , including whether costs were based on charges or claims , the data collection approaches , use of control groups , descriptive analysis of mean costs by stage , regression model choices , censored data analysis , missing data analysis , and timing issues .
We distinguished between whether charges or claims were used because charges are often higher than the insurer claim costs [8] , though either of which does not necessarily reflect the true economic costs of providing the medical services .
Costing data collection methods should depend on the aim of the study and the availability of data [11] .
One method is the ingredient approach , also called micro - costing , with resources and the associated unit costs directly measured .
At the other end of the spectrum is the gross costing or top - down method .
In this approach , the costs are usually estimated by reference costs from a non - patient - specific source [12] .
Gross costing is faster and cheaper but may lead to low accuracy because of the relatively large measurement units .
Micro - costing is more reliable but may be expensive and not always practical [11] .
Non - breast cancer controls were included in some studies .
The costs among patients often incorporate some costs incurred jointly with other diseases or interventions , leading to the overestimation of the disease - specific costs .
By comparing costs of breast cancer cases to control groups without breast cancer , breast cancer - attributable treatment costs can be estimated .
Description of mean costs by stage was reported in all studies .
Some presented only point estimates , while others also reported the uncertainty of mean values , such as standard errors and confidence intervals .
Different regression models have been developed for cost modelling to approach the issues of cost data , such as the skewness , zero - values , and censoring [13] .
In general , in cases of no censoring and no zero - costs , the log - gamma generalised linear model ( GLM ) is favoured , which deals with non - normality and avoids back - transformation issues [14] .
Regarding the zero - cost issues , the two - part mixed model is the most informative by showing the possibility of any expenditure first .
For the censoring issues , a regression model can be used which is weighted by the probability of not being censored .
There is no unique model that can deal with all the problems , and the final choice depends on the type and design of the study .
Missing data could reduce the representativeness of samples and therefore distort inferences about the population .
So we summarised the methods of dealing with missing data in the reviewed studies .
Also , we assessed whether cost calculations were adjusted for inflation or any other changes .
The study area used is the BTH urban agglomeration , which is also called the Greater Beijing region ( Fig 1 ) .
This area is located in Northeast China , at longitude 113 ° 04 ' to 119 ° 53 ' east and 36 ° 01 ' to 42 ° 37 ' north .
It measures 218,000 km 2 and had more than 100 million residents as of 2016 ( National Bureau of Statistics of China , 2016 ) .
The BTH urban agglomeration is the largest urban agglomeration and the most developed economic centre in northern China .
Beijing is the political capital , cultural and information centre of China and is one of the largest megacities worldwide , with more than 21 million people and 5.7 million vehicles in 2016 [55] .
Given the importance of the Greater Beijing region , severe air pollution has been the leading environmental challenge , with frequent occurrences of fog and haze .
Related statistical consensus indicate that the total annual mean values of Beijing ’ s PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations from 2012 to 2015were 138.5 ± 92.9 μ g / m3 and 2.3 ± 54.4 μ g / m3 , respectively [37] .

This monitoring dataset is obtained from the atmospheric physics sites of the 12 cities by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China .
The remote sensing data from the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group ( 2016 ) [56] are initially used in BTH region .
Compared with the remote sensing data on PM 2.5 ( Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group , 2016 ) [56] , spatial interpolation has higher accuracy than remote sensing data in reflecting PM 2.5 concentrations at near - ground level in this study .
These data are measured by 80 monitoring stations distributed throughout the BTH region ( Fig 3 ) .
Each monitoring station automatically measures monthly PM 2.5 concentrations .
Cangzhou , which is a small city , has three air quality monitoring stations .
Other cities have more than five air quality monitoring stations that are distributed from the suburbs to downtown .
The annual average of PM 2.5 concentration for each monitoring station is calculated based on the hourly real - time data .
Beijing , Tianjin and Hebei have 12 , 15 and 53 atmospheric physics observation points , respectively .
Table 1 describes the geographic information on several atmospheric physics observation points .
The geographic information of all observation points is shown in S1 Table .
In terms of data standardisation , the collected PM 2.5 values at 2 : 00 , 8 : 00 , 14 : 00 and 20 : 00 from different observation points are averaged to derive the daily and monthly PM 2.5 concentrations of a city .
The PM 2.5 concentration of 12 sites is the average of 80 sites .

Source : China Meteorological Administration Table 2 describes an array of PM 2.5 - related variables summarised from an extensive literature review .
These variables are tested to identify the critical impact factors for PM 2.5 concentration .
Existing studies on identifying the key contributing factors of PM 2.5 concentration in China have mainly focused on demographic and economic aspects and other chemical air pollutants .
Yang and Chen ( 2017 ) [57] used independent variables , namely , coal consumption , cement production , automobile volume , population and gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
Lu et al . ( 2017 ) [58] incorporated the following variables in their estimation , namely , population density , annual volume of bus passengers , road freight , proportion of secondary industry to overall GDP , volume of SO 2 emissions and volume of industrial soot emission .
Ma and Xiao ( 2017 ) [59] considered urbanisation , energy consumption structure [60] and construction areas in their investigation .
On the basis of an extensive literature review , 12 potential contributing factors for PM 2.5 concentrations are identified ( Table 2 ) .

The possible critical impact factors of PM 2.5 concentration are selected ( Tables 2 and 3 ) , discussed and included in the estimation model .
Since independent variable data in 2016 and 2017 has yet been published by the statistic consensus , this study used the latest data of 2015 in the PLS model to analyse the critical factors for PM 2.5 concentration ( For details , see S3 Table ) .

Data Resource : National Bureau of Statistics of the People ’ s Republic of China ( 2016 a , b ) A comparison of PM 2.5 concentrations with population reveals interesting findings that should be considered .
Shijiazhuang , which is the most polluted city , features a relatively high population density of 788.14 persons / km 2 .
Handan , the second most polluted city , has the highest population density of 870.29 persons / km 2 .
Zhangjiakou , which has the best air quality , presents a low population density of 127.46 persons / km 2 .
Chengde , with a similar pollution level as Shijiazhuang , also manifests a low population density of 96.73 persons / km 2 ( Fig 4 ) .
A common pattern exists in which population density forms a certain positive relationship with PM 2.5 concentration .
However , this pattern is affected by various critical impact factors that lead to certain variations .
Therefore , a detailed investigation on critical PM 2.5 factors should be conducted for a thorough analysis of such particles .

The estimation results reveal that PM 2.5 concentration in the BTH urban agglomeration exhibits a distinctive spatial distribution characteristic .
Related literature shows that coal combustion accounts for 20 % - 30 % of PM 2.5 pollution in Chinese cities [ 20 , 22 , 27 , 28 ] .
In winter , PM 2.5 concentration is usually high because coal is used as the main energy for winter heating .
In summer , the situation significantly differs in the BTH urban agglomeration .
For example , motor vehicles account for 63 % of the carbonaceous components of PM 2.5 in Beijing , while coal combustion accounts for 30.3 % of PM 2.5 compositions because it is used as the major energy source for industrial production in the city [22] .
Therefore , the present study uses industrial dust and industrial SO 2 emissions as parameters to investigate the air pollution contributions of heating and industrial development .
Tangshan shows the highest volumes of industrial SO 2 emission , which amounted to 214,723 t in 2016 , followed by Shijiazhuang and Handan with 113,652 and 110,193 t , respectively .
Xingtai and Handan represent the top two contributors of industrial dust emissions , accounting for 191,713 and 100,738 t , respectively .
Fig 5 shows the volume of industrial soot ( dust ) and sulphur dioxide emissions of 12 cities in BTH .

Several studies argue that transportation exerts a significant adverse influence on air pollution [29] .
On the basis of available data from statistical consensus , ‘ passenger and freight volume of highway traffic ’ are used as a parameter for measuring PM 2.5 pollution from transportation .
Data suggest that polluted cities are generally associated with high road freight volume .
For example , Shijiazhuang , Tangshan and Handan , which are the most polluted cities , are associated with relatively high freight volumes with 3,695,410 , 000 , 363,580,000 and 387,040,000 t , respectively .

PM 2.5 concentration is a scalar description of atmospheric state significantly affected by local human activities .
Although remote sensing has been improved by techniques such as regional correlations in recent years , several studies indicate that spatial interpolation is a powerful approach to replace the inversion method , leading to higher accuracy than remote sensing data in reflecting PM 2.5 concentrations at near - ground level [ 40 , 54 , 64 - 67 ] .
To address this limitation , spatial interpolation is employed and the results of the inversion method are considered as references .
Interpolation methods used in regional - scale factors include inverse distance interpolation ( IDW ) and Kriging interpolation method ( OKM ) .
OKM is a more widely recognised method for dealing with interpolation points than IDW [22] .
This study uses OKM to simulate seasonal variations of PM 2.5 in the 12 cities of the BTH urban agglomeration .
The supporting concept of OKM is that the interpolation results at the target point are the weighted sum of known attribute values of the samples [68] .
In the study area , x represents the spatial location of point x .
z ( xi ) ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) represents the property value of sampling point xi ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) , and annual mean PM 2.5 concentration is the property value of point xi .
Then , the interpolation result at target point x0 is z ( x0 ) : z ( x0 ) = ∑ i = 1n λ iz ( xi ) .
Where λ i ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) depends on undetermined coefficients .
Assuming that the entire study area satisfies the second - order stationary assumption , that is , ‘ the mathematical expectation of z ( x ) exists and is equal to the constant , that is , E [ z ( x ) ] = m ’ , the covariance function of variables z ( x ) exists and only depends on lag value ( h ) , that is , Cov [ z ( x ) , z ( x + h ) ] = E [ z ( x ) z ( x + h ) ] − m2 = C ( h ) .
On the basis of unbiased expectation E [ z * ( x0 ) ] = E [ z ( x0 ) ] , E [ z * ( xi ) ] refers to the spatial variation of PM 2.5 concentration in BTH by OKM in point xi , E [ z * ( x0 ) ] denotes the spatial variation of PM 2.5 concentration in BTH by OKM in point x0 , and z ( x0 ) is the PM 2.5 concentration in point x0 .
We can conclude that ∑ i = 1n λ i = 1 .
For regionalised variables that satisfy the second - order stationary conditions , the estimated variance can be calculated using the following formula : σ E2 = E [ z * ( x0 ) − z ( x0 ) ] 2 − { E [ z * ( x0 ) − z ( x0 ) ] } 2 = ∑ i = 1n ∑ j = 1n λ i λ jCi , j − 2 ∑ i = 1n λ iCi , 0 + C0 , 0 .
To obtain the minimum variance estimation under unbiased conditions , that is , Min { Var [ z * ( x0 ) − z ( x0 ) ] − 2 μ ∑ i = 1n ( λ i − 1 ) } .
The weight coefficients should satisfy the following equations : { ∑ i = 1n λ iCov ( xi , xj ) + μ = Cov ( x0 , xi ) ∑ i = 1n λ i = 1 .
Then , we can calculate the value of λ i ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) and obtain the attribute value z * ( x0 ) at sample point x0 .
The degree of correlation between t1 and u1 should be the maximum .
The two conditions can be summarised as follows : Var ( t1 ) → max Var ( u1 ) → max Var ( t1 , u1 ) → max After the first principal components t1 and u1 are extracted from X and Y , PLS performs linear regressions of X and Y on t1 .
In the PLS estimation , components t1 and u1 have typical component characteristics .
A significant linear relationship between t1 and u1 indicates that X has a notable correlation with Y , and PLS is appropriate for estimating the contribution of X to Y .
The algorithm is terminated when the regression equations reach satisfactory levels .
Otherwise , the residuals of X and Y after regression on t1 are used to extract the next principal component .
The algorithm iterates until the results reach satisfactory levels .
Cross - validation ( Qh 2 ) is used as the measurement criterion to determine whether the regression results reach the satisfactory level .
For the number of extracted principal components h , rounding observation i ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) for each time , ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) , the PLS model is built with the remaining ( n − 1 ) observations .
Then , observation i is substituted in the fitted PLS regression equation to obtain the predicted value of yj ( j = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , q ) at observation i , and the predicted value is recorded as y ( i ) j ^ ( h ) .
The above calculation is repeated for each i ( i = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , n ) .
The sum of the squared errors ( SSE ) for dependent yj is obtained when h principal components are extracted and formtok is recorded .
Then , the sum of SSE for Y = [ y1 , y2 , ⋯ , yq ] is obtained and formtok is recorded .
All observations are likewise used to fit the regression equation with h principal components .
At this time , the prediction value for observation i is noted as y ( i ) j ^ ( h ) .
The sum of SSE for yj is defined as SSj ( h ) = ∑ i = 1n ( yij − y ( i ) j ^ ( h ) ) 2 , and the sum of SSE for Y is defined as SS ( h ) = ∑ j = 1qSSj ( h ) .
Cross - validation is defined as Qh 2 = 1 − PRESS ( h ) / SS ( h − 1 ) Thus , a cross - validation test is performed before the end of each modelling step .
The model estimation reaches a satisfactory level of precision and the extraction of components is stopped if Qh 2 < 1 − 0.952 = 0.0975 is satisfied at step h .
If Qh 2 ≥ 0.0975 is satisfied at step h , then the marginal contribution of the extracted principal component th is significant , and step ( h + 1 ) should be calculated .
After m principal components t1 , t2 , ⋯ , tm are finally extracted from X , PLS first performs a regression of yk on t1 , t2 , ⋯ , tm and converts it in the regression equation of yk on x1 , x2 , ⋯ , xp .
The specific procedures of the PLS algorithm are summarised as follows : Step 1 .
To simplify the calculation and eliminate the effects of different units of variables , this study first standardises the original data matrices ( X and Y ) , which are denoted by E0 and F0 .Step 2 .
Let t1 be the first principal component extracted from E0 .
The regression of E0 and F0 on t1 is performed as formtok p1 and r 1 refer to regression coefficient vectors , and E1 and F1 represent the corresponding residual matrices .
The accuracy of the regression equation is calculated .
The algorithm is terminated when the regression equations reach satisfactory levels .
Otherwise , let E0 = E1 and F0 = F1 , and iterate the component extraction and regression analysis .
Cross validation ( Qh 2 ) is used to evaluate the model until the expected accuracy is obtained .
Step 3 .
The number of regression components should be selected .
The number of regression components included in the PLS model is important because it directly affects the fitting accuracy of the model .
It should be carefully selected based on cross validation ( Qh 2 ) .
If Qh 2 is higher or equal to 0.0975 , then the marginal contribution of component th is significant and contributes to the precision of estimation results.Step 4 .
The regression equation of E0 and F0 on t1 , t2 , ⋯ , tm is derived if the model extracts m principal components .
The following regression equation is developed through inverse transformation.In the calculation of PLS , the principle component th should both represent the variation information of X ( xj ( j = 1 , 2 , … , p ) ) and explain the information of Y ( yk ( k = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , q ) ) as much as possible .
To measure the explanatory power of th for interpreting X and Y , we define various explanatory powers of th as follows : The explanatory power of th to interpret X : formtok cumulative explanatory power of t1 , t2 , ⋯ , tm to interpret X : formtok explanatory power of th to interpret Y : formtok cumulative explanatory power of t1 , t2 , ⋯ , tm to interpret Y : formtok significant advantage of PLS regression is the reliable choice of variables .
When independent variable xj is used to explain the set of dependent variables Y , the variable importance in projection VIPj can be used to measure the importance of xj in interpreting Y [69] .
The expression of VIPj is VIPj = pRd ( Y ; t1 , tm ) ∑ h = 1mRd ( Y ; th ) w2hj , where p represents the number of independent variables , and whj is the linear combination coefficient of the principal component th .
For principle component th , th = wh1x 1 + wh2x 2 + ⋯ + whpxp .
For h = 1 , 2 , ⋯ , m , ∑ j = 1pw 2hj = 1 .
The explanatory power of xj to Y is transferred by th .
Formula formtok indicates that when the values of Rd ( Y ; th ) and w2hj are large , VIP 2j will also gain a large value .
Formula formtok indicates that if the VIPj of all independent variables xj ( j = 1 , 2 , … , p ) equals 1 , then they all play the same role in interpreting Y .
Otherwise , xj exerts a significant effect on interpreting Y when VIPj > 1 .
Most of the data used in this study are archival , aggregate data where the students have been de - identified .
As a result , the work described here was viewed exempt as human subjects research by the University of Florida ' s Institutional Review Board .
However , this analysis is a component of a larger study that was reviewed and approved by the University of Florida ' s Institutional Review Board ( 2012 - U - 0518 ) .
The data was provided by the University of Florida ' s Office of Institutional Planning and Research .
Design of the Distance Education Program : The design of the DE MCS program was based on a framework of seven factors in developing online education programs described by Rovai and Downey [31] .
These factors are planning , marketing and recruitment , financial management , quality assurance , student retention , faculty development , and course design and pedagogy .
Successful online programs engage in strategic planning , which includes forming alliances with key partners that have important roles in the overall program vision [31] .
Three years prior to officially launching the program , the Microbiology and Cell Science department ( MCS ) laid the foundation of a strong partnership with an important two - year partner in the same state , Miami Dade College ( MDC ) .
As the largest institution of higher education in Florida as well as in the United States , MDC represented a critical population of students predominantly from underrepresented backgrounds interested in earning their 4 - year degree from the state ’ s premier research university .
This collaboration led to a signed articulation agreement in 2010 between the University of Florida and Miami Dade College that allowed for a seamless transfer of MDC students interested in the distance education 2 + 2 program .
Since then , similar agreements were signed with Palm Beach State College and St . Petersburg College .
Marketing and recruiting a pool of qualified students is critical for the success of a distance program [31] .
In early 2011 , students were recruited on an individual basis through the help of academic advisors located at the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences ( IFAS ) Research and Education Centers .
These IFAS centers are located throughout the state .
In addition , early marketing efforts including advertisements in the community college newspapers and hiring enrolled students to help with peer recruiting .
After the first semester , it was clear that the recruiting and marketing efforts were not sufficient to generate the numbers of applicants needed for a sustainable program .
The services of a marketing firm that specializes in higher education distance program , Apollidon Learning , were retained .
As recommended as a key factor of a successful distance program , the marketing team developed a program brand .
The brand , logo and color scheme were consistently used in paper marketing materials and the program ’ s website ( http://microbiology.ifas.ufl.edu ) .
Understanding the costs associated with entering a distance education market is very important .
One of the first financial decisions to be made is whether the online program will be organized as a separate division or integrated within the existing structure of the institution [31] .
The DE MCS program uses a hybrid of these two approaches .
Distance education programs at the University of Florida are structured so that the revenue generated from tuition and fees allows the program to be entirely self - sufficient .
Although the DE MCS program has its own financial structure , it is fully integrated within the university in that the distance education ( DE ) students are considered full - time university students and have access to the same university resources including the library , disability resource center , counseling , etc .
Some DE programs increase revenue streams by using a large pool of adjunct instructors instead of full - time faculty to teach distance students .
From the start , the DE MCS program elected to use the same instructors for the DE MCS students as the on - campus students .
The DE MCS students take the same departmental courses as the on - campus students .
The only difference is that the DE students register through a specific section of the course for the purpose of tracking enrollment , tuition , and revenue .
As it may take years before DE programs yield positive net revenues , the university provided an investment of $ 50,000 at the launch of the program for initial expenses .
Originally , the DE MCS program did not include a sizeable budget for marketing and recruitment , but quickly , the value of solid marketing and recruitment efforts became clear .
In return for marketing and recruitment services , Apollidon Learning receives a portion of the income .
The tuition charged to the students of the DE MCS program is precisely the same level as charged to on - campus in - state students .
The semester fees are also identical with the exception of small fees that only apply to on - campus students such as city / campus bus transportation fee ( DE students pay about $ 42 less per year in fees in 2014 ) .
Because the DE MCS program and the traditional MCS program have the same curriculum , courses , instructors , exams , expectations , grading scales , and in many cases , the same mode of delivery , the quality of the DE MCS program should be very similar to the quality of the on - campus program ( see Results ) .
The university has a solid national reputation as a Research 1 university , but is also the flagship university in Florida , and its programs are accredited .
To keep the quality as high and as consistent as possible between the DE MCS program and the on - campus program , instructors in the department have been encouraged to teach lecture courses exclusively through online delivery modes so that all students receive the same course experience .
This approach also encourages the instructors to invest their time in improving the course itself rather than delivering material in multiple ways .
Because the DE MCS program requires that : 1 ) all laboratory courses are taken in the classroom , 2 ) all exams are proctored , and 3 ) all instructors are readily available to DE students through discussion sessions or other formats , the DE MCS courses and degree are accepted by professional schools including medical and dental schools .
As a life sciences program , several laboratory courses are required for the B.S . in MCS degree including introductory biology , introductory chemistry , organic chemistry , and introductory physics with their corresponding laboratories .
All of these lab courses are taken during the first two years as a community college student or at a local college with the credits accepted by the University of Florida .
The MCS major has two required laboratory courses , which students take in a face - to - face format .
These lab courses include an introductory microbiology lab course and an advanced lab course that gives students a more enriched lab experience .
The DE MCS program has established three ways in which students can fulfill these two departmental laboratory requirements .
First , if ten or more DE MCS students are located in the same region , for example near the Indian River Research and Education Center in Ft .
Pierce , the department can rent teaching laboratory space to teach the laboratory courses locally .
Second , students may take equivalent laboratory courses at their local institutions that will be accepted for credit by the University of Florida .
Third , if the first two options are not feasible for the student , the DE MCS program has developed a creative approach to providing laboratory courses for DE students : an immersion laboratory course .
Students come to the main campus for eleven days during the summer term and take the same laboratory courses as the on - campus students , but in an immersion format of several 8 - 10 hour days in a row .
The immersion lab courses use the same curriculum and instructors as the semester - long versions of the laboratory courses .
These three options provide students with ways to meet the laboratory requirements of the degree that work with their professional and personal schedules .
One recurring question from potential students , professional schools , and other interested parties is that of exam proctoring .
All exams are proctored to the same extent as students who take exams in person .
Depending on the course , instructor , and exam type , DE MCS students have taken exams at a regional location monitored by a paid proctor or have taken exams using commercial online proctoring services such as Remote Proctor Now from Software Secure ( http://softwaresecure.com ) or ProctorU ( http://proctoru.com ) .
Data indicates that retention rates in online programs may be lower than student retention in traditional courses [31] .
Factors that may affect retention of distance students are that DE students are more likely to be nontraditional and therefore more likely to have work , family , and financial obligations than on - campus students .
Additionally , DE students may experience a lack of personal connection with other students and faculty .
To address retention , MCS faculty are available to online students via discussion groups , email , and social media sites like Facebook and Twitter .
Students can connect with each other through course discussion pages , chats , emails , and Facebook pages .
The department chair meets with DE MCS students personally or by videoconference at regional locations once each year to address any issues .
Recently , the department was awarded a National Science Foundation grant from the STEM Talent Expansion Program ( STEP ) with our partners at MDC .
This project focuses on using best practices in increasing STEM retention such as scholarships , peer tutoring , research experiences , and career mentoring to increase enrollment , retention and graduation of students from the South Florida region in the DE MCS program .
Faculty development in online teaching has been in progress since before the launch of the program .
Many of the faculty development activities stemmed from faculty interested in learning best practices in online teaching from their own peers .
An annual teaching symposium hosted by the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences , the teaching arm of IFAS , has sessions devoted to online teaching .
The College and MCS have invested in new distance education tools , resources , and the technical support staff to ensure proper delivery of the courses and assessments .
One important factor in the launch and success of this program was to have strong faculty support and interest .
As all departmental courses for DE MCS students are the same as the face - to - face on - campus courses and taught by the same faculty , it was important for faculty to modify their delivery to accommodate the DE students .
Faculty responded to this request with varying degrees of enthusiasm .
However , faculty are encouraged to teach by distance in whichever format suits their style the best .
For example , some faculty use in - class recording to record their lectures in the classroom while others use screen capture software and video podcasting for asynchronous delivery for students .
Allowing faculty to choose their method for course delivery reduced the barrier of entry into the program .
All faculty use the online learning management system supported through the university to host their online class .
Recorded lectures are made available to on - campus as well as DE MCS students .
Online Course Design and Pedagogy : The workshops and symposiums described above also cover online course design .
One strength of the DE MCS program is that faculty are encouraged to use an online pedagogical approach that suits their needs , preferences , and design .
Because instructors can utilize tools of their choice , they have more ownership and investment in the course .
One unique feature of the MCS curriculum is that it integrates genomics and bioinformatics at different levels and in multiple courses .
Genomics and bioinformatics are fields that integrate biology with computer science , which makes these topics a natural fit for online learning .
Student enrollment and demographic data was obtained by request from the Office of Institutional Planning and Research at the University of Florida .
The enrollment data was reported as student headcounts for Microbiology and Cell Science ( MCS ) majors in the Fall semester from years 2009 - 2014 for three categories : on - campus , on - campus transfer , and distance education transfer .
On - campus students are individuals who entered the institution as degree - seeking students and did not transfer from another institution or attend another higher education institution previously .
On - campus transfer students began their undergraduate degree at a different institution and then transferred into the University of Florida as an MCS major .
Typically , these students transfer from a 2 - yr institution in the state to complete their 4 - yr degree .
Distance education transfers ( DE MCS students ) are students who transferred to the university as MCS majors , typically from a 2 - yr institution , but are not physically on campus as they complete their degree in the DE MCS program .
In addition to total headcounts , the Office of Institutional Planning and Research provided the headcounts of Microbiology and Cell Science majors by self - reported Race / Ethnicity .
The DE MCS program is in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences , but students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Florida also have the option to major in MCS .
Although degree requirements for a B.S . in MCS are the same for all MCS majors , there are differences in requirements and expectations for students in the two colleges at the admissions level .
Since the DE MCS program is only available through the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and since the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences does not have a comparable distance education - based program , the demographics , retention , and quality of the DE MCS program is assessed by comparisons with the two most closely related cohorts : MCS on - campus ( admitted as first time in college ) and MCS on - campus transfers ( admitted after attending another institution ) from the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences .
Retention data was obtained from the Office of Institutional Planning and Research and the Office of the University Registrar .
Retention was assessed in two specific transfer cohorts of Microbiology and Cell Science majors who transferred into the university as juniors in the Fall of 2011 and 2012 : on - campus transfers and distance education transfers .
The proportion of students from those cohorts who had graduated or were still persisting towards their B.S . degree at the two year time point ( equivalent to a 4 year graduate rate ) were compared .
To measure academic performance , grade point averages ( GPAs ) were obtained from the Office of the University Registrar and the Office of Institutional Planning and Research .
Two types of GPAs were assessed for the on - campus , on - campus transfers , and DE transfers : current GPAs ( as of October 2013 ) for all students in their junior year or above who were enrolled as MCS majors in the Fall 2013 semester and final GPAs at time of graduation for students who had graduated with a degree in MCS from Fall 2011 - Spring 2014 .
All figures were generated with the R package , ggplot 2 [32] .
Qualtrics was used to develop and disseminate an anonymous and optional survey to the DE MCS students enrolled in the Fall 2014 semester .
Male jirds ( Meriones unguiculatus ) approximately 6 weeks of age ( 50 - 60 g ) were purchased from Charles River ( USA , Kingston K62 jirds ) and infected by intraperitoneal injection with Brugia pahangi third - stage larvae ( L3 ) .
Dosing regimens began a minimum of 12 weeks post - infection following development of the larval stage to the adult stages and secretion of microfilariae .
Animals were allowed to eat and drink ad libitum and maintained following the approved IACUC protocol AN 109629 - 03D .
Oral suspensions of ASD flubendazole ( Janssen Bend 1 / 9 ) contained 10 % FBZ - AAA G001 , 10 % flubendazole : hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate , Lot number BREC - 1113 - 036 with a vehicle of aqueous solution of 0.5 % w / v methocel A4M ( Premium ) in demineralized water .
For the flubendazole subcutaneous suspension ( FBZ - AAA , lot 0020470007 ) , FBZ was purchased from Shaanxi Hanjiang Pharmaceutical Group LTD , Hanzhong City , Shaanxi , China and formulated with aqueous solution of 0.5 % w / v HEC ( 2 - hydroxyethyl cellulose , Sigma 434965 ) in demineralized water and 0.1 % Tween 80 .
Formulations were acclimated for 30 min at room temperature , protected from light and homogenized prior to dosing for at least 30 seconds to ensure no visible sedimentation .
ASD flubendazole was given per os ( PO ) at 0.2 , 0.6 , 1.5 , 6 or 15 mg / kg for 5 consecutive days , or subcutaneously ( SC ) at 10 mg / kg one time or for 5 days ; control groups were not given any treatment which allowed comparison with both the oral and SC groups rather than having to include 2 different vehicle groups ( Table 1 ) .
Doses were selected to determine the efficacy of the new ASD formulation of FBZ after oral administration for 5 days , which is considered a dosing regimen feasible for use in patients in the field as well as on the basis of previous pharmacokinetic and toxicological data .
For the subcutaneous route and doses , the 5 - day 10 mg / kg dose group is used as a positive control group in antifilarial rodent models .
A single dose subcutaneous dose of 10 mg / kg was included to test if the same efficacy could be obtained as with the positive control group .
Table data removed from full text .
Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006787.t001 Dosing regimens for ASD FBZ studies .
All animals used in the study were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane just to the state of drowsiness prior to dosing to avoid any handling stress .
Animals were given PO doses using a metal gavage needle and 1 ml tuberculin syringe .
Animals receiving SC doses were injected on the scruff of their necks with a 25 gauge needle in a clockwise fashion to avoid injection into the same site over the 5 day treatment period .
The untreated control group was also given light anesthesia as in the case with the treated animals but was not dosed .
Animals were allowed to feed ad libitum and dosed according to their body weight determined prior to each dosing .
The takedown times were 68 and 72 days post - first dose .
Samples for pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of ASD FBZ : The sparse sampling approach was used to obtain a sufficient time profile while minimizing stress to the animals , e.g. 2 - 3 animals per group were sampled per time point using the micro - sampling technique .
Blood sampling times were chosen based on the route and duration of treatment and previous PK data , and thereby took into account the allowable volume of blood that could be taken from gerbils without causing stressful manipulation of the animals .
Approximately 30 - 50 μ l of blood was collected per animal from the vena saphena , using heparin - coated hematocrit capillary tubes .
Blood was placed immediately on ice and centrifuged for 1810 g for 15 min at 4 ° C .
10 μ l of plasma was then transferred into a PCR microfuge tube , frozen in a dry ice / ethanol bath and stored at - 80 ° C until shipped .
Plasma samples from jirds were collected at the following times for Experiment 1 : For the SC single dose ( 10 mg / kg ) : 1 , 3 , 8 and 24 hrs post - dose ; for the SC repeat doses ( 10 mg / kg ) : 2 hrs post - dose on Days 1 - 4 ; at Day 5 : 1 , 3 , and 8 , 24 , 48 hrs post - dose ; for the SC groups : weekly for 9 weeks post - last dose ; for the PO repeat doses : 2 hrs post - dose on Days 1 - 4 ; 2 hrs and 24 hrs post - dose on Days 5 .
Plasma samples from jirds were collected at the following times for Experiment 2 : for the SC single dose ( 10 mg / kg ) : 1 , 3 , 8 , 24 and 48 hrs post - dose ; and 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 9 weeks post - dose ; for the PO repeat doses ( 6 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg ) : 2 hrs post - dose on Days 1 - 4 ; 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 24 hrs post - dose on Day 5 .
All flubendazole formulations used in the study were also analyzed at the end of the dosing period .
For Experiment 1 , analyses were conducted at Janssen Research and Development ( 1400 McKean Road , Spring House , PA 19477 ) , and for Experiment 2 , analyses were conducted at Janssen Research and Development , Beerse , Belgium .
For both studies , plasma samples were analyzed individually for flubendazole ( JNJ - 161941 ) , hydrolyzed flubendazole ( H - FBZ , JNJ - 114699 ) and reduced flubendazole ( R - FBZ , JNJ - 1809600 ) using a qualified LC - MS / MS method .
10 μ l plasma aliquots in end - to - end capillaries were washed with 100 μ l of 2 % BSA in phosphate buffer pH 7.5 .
From this diluted sample 44 μ l was taken for analysis corresponding to 4 μ l of plasma .
After addition of 10 μ l of internal standard dilution and 200 μ l of acetonitrile for the precipitation of the plasma proteins , the samples were mixed and centrifuged .
150 μ l of the supernatant was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen flow at 50 ° C and reconstituted in 150 μ l of a mixture of 0.1 % formic acid and acetonitrile ( 90 / 10 , v / v ) .
20 μ l of the extract was injected onto an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column ( 50 x 2.1 mm , 1.7 μ m particles ) ( Waters , Milford , USA ) .
The chromatographic system consisted of a Shimadzu SIL 30ACMP autosampler and Shimadzu LC 30 pumps ( Shimadzu , Kyoto , Japan ) .
The mobile phase was a mixture of 1 % formic acid and acetonitrile with a flow rate of 0.6 ml / min and a 2.5 minute gradient from 20 to 60 % acetonitrile followed by a 1 - minute step gradient to 98 % acetonitrile .
Mass spectrometric detection was performed on an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( Sciex , Framingham , MA , USA ) with Turbo Ion Spray ™ ionization operated in positive ion mode .
FBZ , H - FBZ and R - FBZ were quantified against calibration samples and quality control samples , prepared in the same matrix as the study samples by means of a qualified analytical method with a lower limit of quantitation of 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.2 ng / ml , respectively and an upper limit of quantitation of 3000 ng / ml for all three analytes .
Animals were euthanized on day 68 ( Expt 1 ) and day 72 ( Expt 2 ) after the first dose .
Adult worms and mf were recovered by opening the body cavity and washing the peritoneal cavity with 100 mL of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) .
Male and female worms were separated and counted using a dissecting microscope .
To count the number of mf present in the peritoneal cavity at necropsy , a 100 μ l sample of the aforementioned PBS washing fluid was added to 900 μ l of 0.04 % methylene blue , and then a 50 - 150 μ l sample of the stained mf was streaked onto a glass slide and counted using a compound microscope .
The sample mf counts were multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor to calculate the total number of mf from each jird .
Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by bilateral thoracotomy , following University of California San Francisco IACUC protocol AN 109629 - 03D .
Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) of female Brugia pahangi : At necropsy , 7 - 12 female worms recovered from 2 - 3 jirds per group were fixed in 2.5 % paraformaldehyde , 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer , pH 7.4 [ 34 , 35 ] .
Worms were chopped into 1 - 2 mm long pieces in the fixative .
Samples were incubated for 3 hrs at room temperature protected from light and kept at 4 ° C overnight .
Samples were then washed thoroughly in buffer and post - fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide and 1.6 % potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer , pH 7.4 , for 1 hr .
Following washes in buffer and then in distilled water , en bloc staining was performed for 1 hr with 2 % uranyl acetate with samples protected from light .
Samples were again washed with water and dehydrated through a series of ethanol dilutions : 50 % , 70 % , 95 % and 100 % ethanol .
Samples were infiltrated with a gradient of acetone - Embed 812 resin and embedded in 100 % resin .
After sectioning the solidified blocks , 70 nm sections were post - stained with 1 % uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate .
Images of the sections were collected on a 120kV Microscope ( Philips ) .
To compare adult worm and mf counts in the treated groups versus the control group , raw data were first tested for normality using the Shapiro - Wilk test .
When data did not pass the Shapiro - Wilk test , data were then log 10 transformed and retested using the Shapiro - Wilk test .
In Experiment 2 the log 10 transformation of the total number of adult worms per jird passed the Shapiro - Wilk test , so significance was determined by a one - way ANOVA followed by the Holm - Sidak multiple comparisons test .
The remaining data did not pass the Shapiro - Wilk test , even after log 10 transformation , so significance was determined by the Kruskal - Wallis test , followed by Dunn ’ s multiple comparison test .
All data were analyzed using Prism 6.0f 2014 , GraphPad Software , Inc . with 95 % confidence limits .
To calculate the geometric means of the number of adult worms , female worms and mf recovered at necropsy , 0.1 was used in place of 0 .
The percent efficacy was calculated for each treatment group by subtracting the geometric means of treatment groups from the geometric mean of the control group , multiplying by 100 % , and dividing the numerator by the geometric mean of the control group .
All results written as percentages are given as a geometric mean % ( e.g. geometric mean % reduction ) .
Records of post - vaccination adverse events were queried from the CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System ( VAERS ; access date : May 18th , 2011 ) .
The query was constructed to retrieve adverse event information of killed inactivated vaccines ( TIV group ) consisting of Afluria , Fluarix , Fluvirin , and Fluzone , and live attenuated vaccine ( LAIV group ) FluMist .
The names and the numbers of AEs for each type of vaccines were summarized .
Some AE symptoms are common in both groups , while a significant number of symptoms are unique to each cohort .
Symptoms from both AE record tables differ in rankings ( number of occurrences ) and the nature of adverse events themselves .
We hypothesize that performing a comparative analysis of different physiological responses implied by AE symptoms associated with each vaccine could lead us to understand the underlying response mechanism of the influenza A / B vaccines .
AE report signal detection with Proportional Reporting Ratios ( PRRs ) : Each group of reports ( TIV and LAIV ) was analyzed independently with the PRR method ( as introduced by Evans et al . [11] ) ( Table S1 ) .
PRR calculates the proportions of specific AE ( s ) for a vaccine ( or a group of vaccines ) of interest where the comparator is all other vaccines in the VAERS database .
Therefore , calculations to detect signals from the data pool utilize the total number of reports for each vaccine as a denominator to determine the proportion of all reports that fall in the type of interest ( which in this case is the individual AE that was retrieved by each group of vaccine compared against reports of that particular AE in the total VAERS database pool ) .
The PRR score of individual AEs in each group is then used as one of the composite criteria to compare for significant AEs in each group .
Chi - square test to identify statistically significant AEs : In parallel with PRR signal detection , the Chi - square significance test for contingency tables was applied to individual AE MedDRA terms that are associated with TIV or LAIV independently [11] .
The Chi - square test computes a Chi - square score and probability for each AE in each group using a 2 × 2 frequency / contingency table .
The 2 × 2 contingency table was composed of four disjoint counts based on the total number of all reports in each group ( 37,621 TIV cases , 3,707 LAIV cases ) against the overall VAERS data ( 616,215 cases ) .
An AE was called significant when its Chi - square score was greater than 4 , which implied P - value of approximately 0.05 or smaller [11] .
AE case report frequency as a cutoff for filtering out background noise : Besides the PRR calculation and Chi - square test , the screened PRR method ( SPRR ) also used a minimal sample size cutoff ( [18] [19] ) .
The original SPRR paper uses a minimal sample size cutoff of 3 case reports for each AE to be further considered .
Such a constant cutoff does not work for our project since the two groups ( TIV and LAIV ) of case reports have different case report sizes .
In our study , the sample size cutoff threshold of the number of reports for both groups was determined to be 0.2 % of the total number of reports of each group .
Using this cutoff , the biological implication would mean that at least 2 out of 1000 cases reported the AE of interest .
The selection of the cutoff was supported by the report signal curve on the total case reports for each group ( Figure S1 A and B ) .
In either TIV or LAIV case , the 0.2 % cutoff line was able to cut off many AEs which are in the bottom of the signal curve and considered as “ noise ” .
The cutoff line is located in a similar pattern in both cases ( Figure S1 A and B ) , suggesting that the 0.2 % cutoff removes “ noise ” AEs in each group correspondingly .
The number of cases for one AE to get called in for TIV group was evaluated to be 75 ( number of reports > = 75 ) , while the cutoff for LAIV group was evaluated at 8 ( number of reports > = 8 ) .
To determine which AEs were exclusively enriched for TIV or LAIV , we excluded AEs that appeared as common signals in both lists .
We also excluded ambiguous AEs such as no adverse event , or those of lab test result normal .
We were then left with 48 TIV - enriched AEs and 68 LAIV - enriched AEs .
These are AEs that their corresponding PRR score is at least 2 , and Chi - square is greater than 4 ( approximately of probability value of 0.05 or smaller ) .
Comparison of concept reorganization based on semantic similarity of the Ontology of Adverse Events ( OAE ) : The OAE ( http://www.oae-ontology.org/ ) was previously named the Adverse Event Ontology ( AEO ) [15] .
The change of the name space was applied to avoid a conflict with another ontology .
OAE was downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/oae/ .
OAE was visualized with the Protege 4.0.2 OWL editor .
For better comparison and analysis , related MedDRA terms associated with TIV and LAIV were mapped to corresponding OAE terms .
However , the ontological structures of these terms in the two systems are often different .
TIV - and LAIV - related AEs were classified based on the OAE structure hierarchy for comparative analyses .
Specifically , the TIV - and LAIV - specific AEs and their parent term hierarchies were extracted from the OAE using the OntoFox program [16] .
The hierarchical results were visualized using the Protege - OWL editor and manually studied and compared .
To compare the performances of classification using different ontologies , TIV - and LAIV - specific AE terms were also classified using SNOMET - CT , and COSTART / MedDRA .
All protocols and sample collections were approved by the IRB of the Massachusetts General Hospital and all data were analysed anonymously .
The STAR * D cohort [16] has been extensively used in many genetic studies and has been thoroughly documented [17] .
Lifetime history of suicide attempts was assessed at the initial study visit by the study clinician and suicidal behavior was not exclusionary for the initial STAR * D patient recruitment , provided the patient did not require hospitalization [18] .
Genotyping for the STAR * D cohort utilized the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500 K Array Set and the Affymetrix Human SNP Array 5.0 [19] .
Genotypes for samples run on the Affymetrix 500 K Array ( n = 969 ) were called using the BRLMM algorithm , and those analyzed on Affymetrix Array 5.0 ( n = 979 ) were called using the BRLMM - P algorithm .
Additional QC was performed using PLINK [20] , where individuals or SNPs were excluded with total call - rates < 95 % , SNPs with call rates < 98 % , individuals with minor allele frequencies < 1 % , or out of Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( p < 1 × 10 − 6 ) .
We imputed missing genotypes using MACH and retained SNPs with r 2 > 0.8 .
Eleven subjects were excluded due to missing clinical data resulting in a final dataset of 1 , 262 .
CNVs were identified using Birdseye [21] , which identifies CNVs by integrating intensity data from neighboring probes using a hidden Markov model ( HMM ) on a per - individual basis .
Performance is dependent on a number of factors including SNP and copy number probe density , mean intra - individual probe variance and CNV frequency .
For each CNV a LOD score was generated that describes the likelihood of the CNV relative to no CNV over the given interval .
All CNV analysis were performed in PLINK and only those CNVs present in less than 10 % of the total sample were used for analysis .
Secondary controls for the current study came from the Database of Genomic Variants ( http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/ ) , a database of over 100 , 000 CNVs from over 40 studies .
While these studies do not explicitly screen for mood disorders , only controls from these studies are in the database .
This household survey was conducted as part of a larger study to identify and quantify the major barriers to the scale up and use of interventions to control malaria in pregnancy at the district , facility , and community level .
The study was conducted in Greater Nyando District ( now divided into Nyando , Muhoroni and Nyakach districts ) in Nyanza Province , Kenya , between February and March 2010 .
Greater Nyando District has a population of 355,800 ( 1999 census ) , with more than 90 % living in rural areas .
Malaria is perennial holo - endemic with a parasite prevalence of 8.3 % among women of child bearing age ( 2008 unpublished data , KEMRI / CDC ) , peaking between April to June and October to December .
HIV prevalence among women aged 15 - 49 years is higher in Nyanza Province compared to all other provinces in the country , 18 % compared to national average of 9 % [24] .
Greater Nyando had a total of 40 health facilities of which 60 % ( 24 ) were owned by government , 13 % ( 5 ) by missions , 18 % ( 7 ) privately owned and 10 % ( 4 ) community run .
The government facilities comprised 1 hospital , 2 sub - district hospitals , 6 health centres and 15 dispensaries , the mission owned 1 hospital , 3 health centres and 1 dispensary and the community owned 4 dispensaries .
In line with WHO recommendations on focussed antenatal care ( FANC ) , national policy in Kenya is for pregnant women to receive a package of interventions through antenatal care at each of 4 recommended ANC visits .
Malaria in pregnancy interventions are delivered alongside prevention and control of mother to child transmission of HIV ( PMTCT ) , tuberculosis , syphilis / sexually transmitted infections , palpations and birth planning .
Malaria services include a free long - lasting insecticide treated net ( LLIN ) provided to all women at their first ANC visit , a minimum of two doses of SP taken under DOT and prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria episodes with an effective antimalarial alongside health education at ANC [25] .
According to current national guidelines , the first dose of SP should be given to all women after quickening and subsequent dose ( s ) taken at least 4 weeks ( one month ) apart .
HIV positive pregnant women taking daily cotrimoxazole should not be given IPTp - SP [25] , [26] .
Kenya adopted IPTp policy in 1999 , followed by the delivery of ITNs to pregnant women through ANC in 2001 .
National level DHS data available at the time the study was designed ( DHS 2003 ) showed that 84 % of women made two or more ANC visits , 4 % pregnant women received two doses of SP during ANC visits and 4 % of pregnant women used an ITN the night before the survey [24] .
The IPTp and ITN coverage figures for Nyanza Province were marginally higher than the national average , with 5 % reporting having received two doses of IPTp and 9 % pregnant women reporting having used an ITN the night before the survey .
Study Design and Selection of Study Participants : A two stage cluster sampling household survey was undertaken over 3 weeks during a period of intense rains , between February and March 2010 .
Enumeration areas from the 1999 census were used to select 40 villages , representing clusters , using probability proportional to size .
A sample size of 338 women of child - bearing age ( 15 - 49 years ) was sufficient to estimate an IPTp or ITN uptake of 50 % , with a 6 % precision , design effect of 1.75 and 10 % non - response .
The sample size was increased to 1,120 to maintain precision in a range of intermediate processes in the delivery of IPTp and ITNs with decreasing sample size , where women are lost from the evaluable sample at different points [27] , and uses the hypothetical assumptions that 60 % of women attending ANC are offered an ITN , of which 50 % then use the ITN .
Households in selected clusters were mapped using Global Positioning System ( GPS ) software ( CDC GPS Sample for Windows Mobile devices https://sites.google.com/a/wolkon.com/gps-sample/ ) .
Thirty five households were randomly selected from GPS coordinates of all households within each cluster to get 28 households with women of childbearing age as resident .
One respondent within each household was selected using a set of predefined criteria as follows : women must be aged 15 - 49 years ; pregnant women were prioritised over mothers of children aged under one year , who were prioritised over other eligible women ; and if more than one eligible woman was currently pregnant / mother of a child aged under 1 , the woman most closely related to the head of the household was interviewed ( i.e. wife > daughter > sister > niece / aunt > daughter - in - law ) .
The questionnaire sought to obtain key coverage indicators on the frequency and timing of ANC attendance , the frequency , timing and source of IPTp - SP doses and whether each dose was taken under DOT , and whether an ITN was obtained , by source , and used during the current / most recent pregnancy ; to understand women ’ s knowledge of malaria in pregnancy in relation to use of IPTp and ITNs ; and to determine whether HIV status alters behaviour patterns .
A composite malaria knowledge score was created based on the cumulative score of correct responses in relation to source of malaria ( mosquitoes ) , consequences of malaria in pregnancy to mother ( anaemia ) and unborn child ( miscarriage , low birth weight , premature birth , stillbirth ) and of methods to prevent malaria in pregnancy ( e.g. IPTp , nets and / or ITNs ) .
HIV status was self - reported , and additional indirect questions about recognition and use of cotrimoxazole and history of episodes of opportunistic infections associated with HIV were included .
Self - reported IPTp , ITN and ANC practices , including HIV testing and results , were compared with data contained in ANC cards where available .
Recording of household assets to develop a wealth index and observation of household ITNs in situ was also performed .
Principal components analysis was used to construct a wealth index to assess socio - economic status ( SES ) [28] , [29] using household characteristics such as education of the household head , number of sleeping rooms , floor materials , source of drinking water , type of toilet facilities , household ownership and a range of household assets .
The questionnaire was translated and back translated to ensure accuracy of translation of concepts and variables , and then pre - tested .
Interviewers were trained to conduct the interviews in the two most commonly spoken local languages , Dholuo and Kiswahili .
The concept of intervention effectiveness as described by Vlassoff and Tanner showed how the translation of the efficacy of a disease control tool into community effectiveness was dependent on coverage , diagnostic accuracy and the compliance of users and providers [30] .
More recently this concept has been adapted for delivery of interventions through the health system [21] , and used as a health systems effectiveness framework by the malERA consultative group [33] .
We adapted this concept specifically for the delivery of IPTp and ITNs through ANC to measure delivery system effectiveness using household data to identify critical points in the delivery system that were ineffective ( Figure 1 ) .
We then explored the predictors of effectiveness at critical points of weakness identified in the delivery pathway .

Data from the household surveys were collected on personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) .
All analyses were adjusted for the survey design , clustering of households and sample weights using STATA 11 .
Socio - demographic characteristics of pregnant and recently pregnant women were described and compared .
Proportions of women accessing ANC , receiving each dose of SP by source and the timing of each dose , and receiving ITNs by source were quantified among both groups of women .
The indicator for ITN use among pregnant women was the proportion of pregnant women who reported having used an ITN the night before the survey [34] , [35] , and for recently pregnant women the indicator used was the proportion of women who reported having used an ITN regularly during the most recent pregnancy [36] , [37] .
The systems effectiveness analysis was undertaken using recently pregnant women and excluded HIV positive women with documented use of cotrimoxazole .
Systems effectiveness was defined as the proportion of women attending ANC who reported having received at least two doses of SP and used an ITN regularly during the most recent pregnancy .
Two categories of effectiveness analyses were applied - ‘ intermediate process effectiveness ’ and ‘ cumulative systems effectiveness ’ [38] .
Intermediate process effectiveness represents coverage of women at each of the intermediate steps in the delivery of IPTp , with the addition of ‘ used any ITN ’ and then ‘ used an ITN from ANC ’ together with taking the second dose of IPTp as the final process .
Intermediate process effectiveness was calculated as the number of women who successfully completed the intermediate process ( the numerator ) as a proportion of all women who reached that point in the delivery system ( the denominator ) ( see formula in Figure 2 ) .
An intermediate process was classified as ineffective if < 80 % women successfully completed that step .
Cumulative systems effectiveness represents successful coverage of women for each of the intermediate steps up to that point in the delivery system .
The final step represents the percent of eligible women in the community that received both interventions and is equivalent to a cumulative coverage indicator for several indicators ( two ANC visits , two doses of SP ( IPTp ) and ITN use ) that are measured by DHS .

Intermediate process effectiveness and cumulative systems effectiveness analyses for IPTp were performed on women receiving IPTp in an eligible month of gestation ( 4 to 9 months ) and excluded women who did not receive IPTp and who were taking cotrimoxazole as documented on ANC cards as per national policy .
This analysis was conducted under two scenarios , Scenario A where the criteria of receiving IPTp by DOT was not included , and Scenario B where women received IPTp by DOT i.e. per policy .
The systems effectiveness analysis for ITNs was not restricted by gestational age as policy states ITNs are to be delivered to women at their first ANC visit regardless of gestation .
Univariate analyses of potential predictors of receipt of : i ) two doses of SP ( with or without DOT ) ; ii ) one dose by DOT ; and iii ) two doses by DOT ( as the three least effective processes identified in the effectiveness analysis ) , was conducted using logistic regression models accounting for survey design , and adjusted Wald tests were applied to test for associations between predictors and outcomes .
We also explored the predictors of ITN use .
Predictors explored included those known to be important from previous studies , including : selected individual and household socio - demographic factors ( women ’ s age , marital status , education , malaria knowledge using the composite malaria knowledge score , urban : rural residence and SES ) ; gravidity ; having lost a live born child ; number and timing of ANC visits ; whether they recently had an episode of malaria and whether they took medicine for that episode .
Variance inflation factors were examined for all predictors included in the models to assess potential collinearity .
Potential predictors significant at the 10 % level ( p < 0.1 ) in the univariate analyses were included in multivariable logistic regression models to determine which factors were associated with the outcomes after accounting for other potential predictors .
Interactions between paired predictors were assessed for all predictors included in the models .
We estimated the potential and actual effectiveness of the malaria in pregnancy prevention strategy on low birth weight ( LBW ) extrapolated to the pregnant population of Nyanza Province ( n = 225,001 ) .
We used the protective efficacy of IPTp on LBW of 29 % observed in a meta - analysis of trials which compared 2 - dose IPTp with SP to case management or placebo in women during their first or second pregnancy ( RR 0.71 ; 95 % CI 0.55 - 0.92 ) [5] , a prevalence of LBW of 12 % ( unpublished data from Siaya District Hospital , Ouma personal communication ) , and co - coverage with IPTp by DOT and ITNs , using the following formula [39] : The study was approved by the ethical committees of the Kenya Medical Research Institute ( KEMRI ) National Ethics Review Committee , the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine , the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta .
Written informed consent was obtained from women prior to being interviewed at home and for adolescents , both parental permission and assent of the subject was obtained .
Forty - five participants ( 70 - 164 months ; Mage = 110.89 ; 34 male ) with primary diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ; 14.9 % ) , Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ; 34 % ) , Learning Disorder / Intellectual Disorders ( LD / ID ; 40.4 % ) , or Anxiety ( 2.1 % ) were drawn from a neuropsychological clinic - referred sample .
They constitute the complete subset of a larger clinic - referred sample ( see below ) that completed the measures relevant to the present investigation .
Participants ’ data used for this study was identified from among a sample of evaluations of children who were referred to the Pediatric Neuropsychology Service at the University of Chicago between 2002 - 2013 ( N = 1500 ) .
Referrals for evaluation were typically received from pediatricians and treating specialty physicians to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the child ’ s neuropsychological status within the context of clinical concerns regarding functioning and learning .
Children between the ages of two and emerging adulthood , with challenges affecting learning , behavioral regulation , emotional functioning , or social skills , comprise the broader clinic sample .
All evaluations were conducted in the outpatient service and were directed and supervised by a licensed clinical psychologist with specialty training in pediatric neuropsychology .
Tests selected for the assessment were based on clinical referral questions , and were administered and then scored by either a trained MA - level full - time psychometrician , or a graduate student trainee in clinical psychology who was certified as a psychometrician for the Service .
Rechecking of scoring was undertaken for all cases .
When warranted , formal clinical diagnoses were established utilizing DSM - IV - TR criteria .
Families and referral sources were provided with a final report to guide intervention of academic , emotional / behavioral , and social needs .
At the first appointment , the child ’ s parent or legal guardian was presented with a written consent for their child ’ s participation in the clinical evaluation , and for their allowance of deidentified data from the assessment to be utilized in ongoing service research .
Children utilized for this study were all from among those whose parents consented to both the assessment and data research use ; consenting process and study procedures were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board .
As noted above , given the nature of the referral , all children included in this study were presented with a clinical neuropsychological battery that included assessment of their intellectual functioning ( see below ) , language expression and comprehension , verbal and visual memory , visuospatial processing and sensorimotor abilities , attention , executive functioning , and emotional and behavioral status .
Relevant to the study , all children received the measures discussed below ; this led to the reduction in available participants for the study , given tests administered and diagnoses of concern .
That is , the sample included here represents 100 % of those who completed all of the measures described below .
Participants completed the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment , Second Edition ( NEPSY - II ) [68] subscales focusing on affect decoding ( Affect Recognition ) , social memory ( Memory for Faces ) , motor skills ( Fingertip Tapping ) , visuomotor skills ( Imitating Hand Positions ) , response inhibition ( Arrows ) , attention & set - shifting ( Auditory Response Set ) , verbal comprehension ( Comprehension of Instructions ) .
This measure has been well - validated ( including during the norming stage ) in the diagnostic groups employed in the present study , and employs standard scores that adjust for norms by age [ 51 , 68 - 70 ] .
Participants also completed standard IQ measures from either the Wechsler [71-73] or Differential Ability Scales [74] batteries .
Mothers completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children , Second Edition ( BASC - 2 ) [75] , which is well - normed across the age ranges and diagnostic groups used here .
The BASC - 2 Atypicality and Social Skills scales are key indicators of populations with common social deficits ( e.g. , ADHD and ASD ) [ 76 , 77 ] , were analyzed .
We first conducted preliminary analyses to detect deviations from normality , and judged whether extreme skewness and / or kurtosis precluded executing parametric analyses .
We then computed bivariate correlations between measures to assess presence of sufficient collinearity to support the use of ( PLSR ) .
That is , PLSR requires all or most independent variables to be substantially intercorrelated in order to effectively obtain reliable estimates of combinations among them [64] .
This is similar to factor analysis in that bivariate correlations must be obtained prior to multivariate estimates .
Given the potentially incommensurate nature of the scales by which the predictors and outcomes are calculated , both parametric ( Pearson ’ s r ) and nonparametric ( Spearman ’ s rho ) correlations were conducted .
Next , as is frequently done when deriving PLSR models [78] , all variables were converted to Z - scores to facilitate appropriate scaling of derived linear combinations in PLSR .
To test our first exploratory hypothesis , that linear combinations of NEPSY - II variables related to affective processing ( Affect Recognition , Memory for Faces ) , motor planning and execution ( Fingertip Tapping , Imitating Hand Positions ) , inhibition ( Arrows , Auditory Response Set ) , and linguistic processing ( Comprehension of Instructions ) could be used to optimize cross - sectional prediction of BASC - 2 mother - reported child Atypicality , we fit a corresponding PLSR model .
We then evaluated the appropriate number of independent variables by examining the Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction ( RMSEP ) of each PLSR component , using Random Segment Cross - Validation on the entire sample , seeking the smallest value after the intercept .
Next , we examined the loadings for each of the NEPSY - II variables to theoretically define each obtained component .
Next , we examined the amount of variance in the cross - sectional predictor variables explained by the chosen component to ensure it accounted for a large proportion ( qualification of variance estimates completed in accordance with Cohen ’ s recommendations ) [79] .
Next , we specified the corresponding Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) regression model with the specified number of components , as well as a Backwards Stepwise Regression model ( i.e. the traditional approach to identifying significant concurrent predictors in this literature ) , and compared the amount of variance in Atypicality explained by these models to the amount explained by the PLSR model to ensure that predictive power was maximized .
To test our second hypothesis , that discrete linear combinations could likewise be used to predict concurrentBASC - 2 Social Skills , we repeated this process .
Finally , we conducted post - hoc analyses to examine whether the derived loading patterns were optimally effective for each of three subgroups ( Learning Disorders , ADHD , Autism Spectrum Disorders ) of participants .
We did this by creating dummy coded variables for each subgroup .
Then , we specified an OLS regression with three predictors : the subgroup indicator , each child ’ s score for the specified PLSR component , and the interaction between the two ( if there was more than one PLSR component , this process was repeated for each component ) .
If the interaction term was significant ( p < .05 ) , it was taken to indicate that the relation between the derived PLSR component and the BASC - 2 outcome was especially descriptive of the given subgroup .
We note that the present sample size ( n = 45 ) is sufficient to conduct PLSR [64] .
Indeed PLSR has been effectively used with samples as small as 10 cases [65] , and PLSR often produces greater statistical power than traditional multiple regression [63] .
A past Monte Carlo simulation indicates that N ~ 50 is sufficient to model at least 2 - 3 latent factors [65] .
Additionally , PLSR statistical power is affected by normality of the distribution of observed variables [80] ; thus , the Z - score transformation discussed above serves to increase statistical power with the present data .
Partial least squares ( PLS ) regression is a method for modeling a relationship between two sets of multivariate data via a latent space , and of performing least squares regression in that space .
PLS can handle high - dimensional co - linear datasets because of its underlying assumption that the two datasets are generated by a small number of latent components .
In this process , latent components are formed by maximizing the covariance between the two datasets .
Partial Least Squares Regression ( PLS ) : PLS models a linear relationship between two blocks of variables formtok and { yi } i = 1n ∈ Rq .
In the following parts , X = ( x1 , … , xn ) T represents the ( n × p ) predictor matrix and Y = ( y1 , … , yn ) T represents the ( n × q ) response matrix .
This procedure obtains L latent components as { ti } i = 1L and { ui } i = 1L .
This technique assumes following decomposition : X = TPT + Fx ( 1 ) Y = UQT + Fy , ( 2 ) where both T = ( t1 , … , tL ) and U = ( u1 , … , uL ) are the ( n × L ) matrices of L latent components corresponding to X and Y , respectively .
The ( p × L ) matrix P and the ( q × L ) matrix Q are loadings and the ( n × p ) matrix Fx and the ( n × q ) matrix Fy are the matrices of residuals .
Since our objective is to perform least squares regression in a low - dimensional latent space , the underlying assumption is that the latent component ui can be well predicted from ti from a relation such as : U = TD , ( 3 ) where D is the ( L × L ) matrix .
We need to maximize the covariance between ti and ui to satisfy the above assumption .
Our objective criterion is maxt , ucov ( t , u ) = maxw , ccov ( Xw , Yc ) , ( 4 ) where w ∈ Rp and c ∈ Rq are weight vectors for projection into the latent components .
After extracting the latent component , the observation matrices X and Y are deflated by subtracting their rank - one approximation .
It is important to stress the asymmetry scheme , i.e. that Y is deflated based on t , in the case of regression .
By repeating the above procedures L times , we obtain the weight matrices W = ( w1 , … , wL ) and C = ( c1 , … , cL ) .
Finally , the relation in the original data space is expressed by Y = XB + E , ( 5 ) where B is the ( p × q ) matrix of regression coefficients and E is the ( n × q ) matrix of residuals .
Plugging the relationship B = W ( PTW ) − 1CT [ 27 , 28 ] into Eq ( 5 ) , we obtain a different representation of Y as : Y ^ = XB ( 6 ) = XW ( PTW ) - 1CT ( 7 ) = XXTU ( TTXXTU ) - 1TTY .
( 8 ) The final transformation is derived from the following equalities [29] , W = XTU , ( 9 ) P = XTT , ( 10 ) C = YTT . ( 11 ) Note that tiTtj = δ ij ( the Kronecher delta ) takes the values 1 for i = j and 0 for i ≠ j as a consequence of the algorithm .
In general , B is obtained from a centered training dataset .
The response ynew for a new subject xnew , referred to as test dataset , is then estimated as follows : ynew = y + BT ( xnew - x ) , ( 12 ) where y and x represent the mean predictor and response in the training dataset , respectively .
A schematic outline of PLS is illustrated in Fig 1 and S1 Appendix .

Two blocks of data , X and Y , are projected by w and c onto latent components , t and u , and least squares regression is performed .
p and q represent loading vectors .
Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression ( KPLS ) : Linear PLS is easily extended to nonlinear regression using a kernel trick [ 28 , 30 ] .
Let ϕ : Rp → H be a nonlinear transformation of the predictor , x ∈ Rp , into a feature vector , ϕ ( x ) ∈ H , where H is a high - dimensional feature space .
Define a Gram matrix K as inner products of points in feature space , i.e. , K = Φ Φ T , where Φ = ( ϕ ( x1 ) , … , ϕ ( xn ) ) T represents the predictor matrix in feature space .
In general , the number of columns of Φ is so large that with the explicit form of Φ , we can not perform the same procedure as in the linear case .
However , due to the kernel trick , the explicit form of Φ becomes unnecessary .
The deflation procedure is performed as follows : K ← ( In - ttT ) K ( In - ttT ) ( 13 ) Y ← Y - ttTY , ( 14 ) where In represents an n - dimensional identity matrix .
We obtain the prediction on the training data from : Y ^ = Φ B ( 15 ) = Φ Φ TU ( TT Φ Φ TU ) - 1TTY ( 16 ) = KU ( TTKU ) - 1TTY . ( 17 ) To exclude the bias term , we assume that the responses and the predictors are set to have zero mean in the feature space by applying the following procedure to test kernel Kt and training kernel K [31] : Kt ← ( Kt - 1n 1nt 1nTK ) ( In - 1n 1n 1nT ) ( 18 ) K ← ( In - 1n 1n 1nT ) K ( In - 1n 1n 1nT ) , ( 19 ) where 1n represents the n - length vector whose n elements are 1 .
Note that n and nt represent the number of training and test samples , respectively .
In the following section of this paper , we investigate three kernel functions : 1 ) a second order polynomial kernel k ( x , x ′ ) = ( xTx ′ + 1 ) 2 , referred to as KPLS - Poly ( 2 ) , 2 ) a third order polynomial kernel k ( x , x ′ ) = ( xTx ′ + 1 ) 3 , referred to as KPLS - Poly ( 3 ) , 3 ) a Gaussian kernel k ( x , x ′ ) = exp ( − γ | | x − x ′ | | ) 2 ) , referred to as KPLS - Gauss , where γ is a hyper parameter and set to the inverse of the median of the Euclidian distance of data points .
In addition to predicting clinical measures , our aim is to classify subjects into depressed patients and healthy controls using the predicted value of clinical measures for objective diagnosis .
We evaluate generalization of binary classifiers using linear discriminant analysis ( LDA ) .
Given the training data Dtr = { xtr , ytr , ztr } and test data Dte = { xte , yte , zte } , x ∈ Rp , y ∈ Rq , and z ∈ { 0 , 1 } represent functional connectivity as predictors , clinical measures as responses , and binary labels ( i.e. 0 is patients and 1 is healthy controls ) , respectively .
In the prediction phase , our objective is to learn the function fB : Rp → Rq , which , given predictors , xtr , and responses , ytr , assigns predictors to the most probable values of y .
The prediction on the training dataset is y ^ tr = fB ( xtr ) .
In the next classification phase , our objective is to learn the classifier gw : Rq → { 0 , 1 } , which , given predicted responses , y ^ tr , and binary labels , ztr , assigns predicted responses to the most probable labels .
Assigned labels on the test dataset are obtained as z ^ te = gw ( y ^ te ) = gw ( fB ( x ^ te ) ) .
It is important to stress that the binary classifier is not trained on actual clinical measures , ytr , but on predicted values of y ^ tr .
In a previous study [13] , the authors only identified the binary classifier gw ′ : Rp → 0 , 1 , which , given functional connectivity , xtr , and binary labels , ztr , assigns functional connectivity directly to binary labels .
By exploiting the predicted result of clinical measures , it may be possible to improve classification performance .
We compared two scenarios , i.e. i ) classification of patients and healthy controls using LDA from predicted clinical measures with KPLS ( with KPLS - Gauss , KPLS - Poly ( 3 ) , and KPLS - Poly ( 2 ) ) , PLS , and ordinary least squares regression ( OLS ) , ii ) classification of patients and healthy controls by means of LDA and SVM from functional connectivity directly .
Note that we perform feature selection before scenario 2 ) by calculating connection - wise t - tests to determine the connections with different group means , represented by t - scores .
We select the M functional connections with the highest absolute t - scores .
M is optimized by cross validations .
Even though PLS can cope with high - dimensional , co - linear datasets , we prescreened variables depending on their relevance to responses in the following way .
Based on Pearson correlation coefficients , ρ rl , between the r - th functional connection and the l - th clinical measures , we define the empirical relevance of the r - th functional connection as formtok where p is the total number of functional connections .
These functional connections are ranked according to their empirical relevance , { Rr } r = 1p , and only M relevant functional connections are used in following procedure .
The optimal number for M was determined through nested leave - one - out cross - validation .
Conventionally , cross validation is employed to assure generalization ability of a model or to evaluate optimal parameters .
Since we have to account for both generalization ability and parameter optimization , we made use of nested leave - one - out cross validation ( LOOCV ) , which consisted of outer and inner LOOCV .
The outer LOOCV repeats iterations that split the whole set of samples into a single outer validation sample used to evaluate the generalization ability , and an outer training set for model estimation .
The inner loop of LOOCV is performed on the outer training set to optimize two parameters , M and L , the number of selected predictor variables and the number of components , respectively .
The pair of parameters that achieves the lowest root mean squared error based on the inner validation sample are adopted as optimal parameters and used to evaluate the model using the outer LOOCV .
These steps are repeated until each sample has served as the validation sample .
Age is significantly correlated with three clinical measures ( Table 2 ) .
In general , age matching performed on different diagnostic groups reduces sample size , causing poor performance .
To avoid this problem , we investigated three models , i.e. ( i ) a model with age as a response ( denoted by output - age ) , ( ii ) a model with age as a predictor ( denoted by input - age ) , and ( iii ) a model without age ( denoted by no - age ) .
By incorporating age into our model , we can cope with age differences among subjects and can fairly evaluate prediction performance .
Interpretation of each latent component projected from input and output data gives novel insights into the relationship between functional connectivity and clinical measures .
In the framework of PLS , loading matrices , P and C , indicate contributions from predictor variables and response variables to each latent component ( see Eqs ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) ) .
The ( i , j ) - element of the loading matrix , P , represents the contribution of the i - th functional connection to the j - th latent component .
Similarly , the ( i , j ) - element of the loading matrix , C , represents the contribution of the i - th clinical measure to the j - th latent component .
Note that due to subject variability , values of Pij and Cij vary depending on the training set used .
The current study was approved by the Academic Committee of the School of Psychology at South China Normal University .
All participants gave written informed consent before participating in the experiments .
Eighteen volunteers ( male ; 18 - 24 years old ) were recruited from local universities for the fMRI experiment .
All of them were philharmonics , but not music professional , who had engaged in some musical training or activities ( e.g. , choir , Musical Instruments class ) before the experiment .
They were right handed and reported no prior history of neurological or psychiatric problems .
Participants were given a small payment after the experiment .
The musical materials selected for the present research consisted of popular music excerpts , artistic music excerpts ( opera ) , and clips of meaningless musical notes in form of playing and singing ( please see supplementary material for demo , including S1 File : popular music sample , S2 File : artistic music sample and S3 File : control material sample ) .
The former two musical materials were snipped from songs from CDs or the internet with the theme of love .
These songs were all performed by female vocalists , and the lyrics were in languages other than English and Chinese .
The notes clips were made in our lab and applied as control stimuli .
With the GoldWave ( Version 5.58 , GoldWave Inc . , www.goldwave.com ) , all stimuli were standardized to a proper length and identical volume ( 16dB ) .
Each excerpt began with 500 ms of gradual fade in , and ended up with 500 ms of gradual fade out .
30 popular music , 32 artistic music and 35 notes clips were prepared for pretesting .
The duration of the popular and artistic music was between 12 - 24 s , and that of the notes was 10 - 15 s .
Moreover , beauty and familiarity evaluations for all these materials were collected using a 7 - point Likert scale from another eighteen participants , who shared the same age and musical experience with the fMRI participants .
Based on the pretesting , 40 musical excerpts were selected by matching the beauty , familiarity and length , with half for the popular music and half for the artistic music .
The familarity ratings for popular and artistic music were : 3.41 ± 0.33 vs . 3.31 ± 0.37 ; the beauty ratings for popular and artistic music were : 5.17 ± 0.35 vs . 4.98 ± 0.37 ; and the lengths for popular and artistic music were : 17.80 ± 2.65s vs . 17.85 ± 3.88s .
For these three dimensions , there was no significant difference between popular and artistic music ( ps > 0.05 , all ) .
28 clips of musical notes playing and singing were chosen for the baseline condition by matching the familiarity and total duration between musical ( popular and artistic music ) and non - musical ( note ) materials .
The average length of notes clips was 12.14 ± 1.27s .
The familiarity ratings for note clips ( 3.29 ± 0.49 ) were not remarkably different from those for popular and artistic music excerpts , whereas the beauty ratings of note clips ( 2.81 ± 0.33 ) were significantly lower than those of musical materials , both p = .000 ( LSD ) .
All the auditory stimuli were present binaurally with a high - quality MRI - compatible headphone system ( SA - 9800B , Shenzhen Sinorad Medical Electronics , Inc . ) .
The volume of auditory stimuli was individually adjusted before fMRI scanning .
Participants were asked to close their eyes during the experiment and open their eyes during the break .
Visual instructions were presented on a screen back - projected on a head coil - mounted mirror .
The experiment program was conducted by the E - Prime 1.2 ( Psychology Software Tools , Inc . , Pittsburgh , PA ) .
Prior to fMRI scanning , participants underwent a training session to become acquainted with the procedures .
In the training session , the materials and the number of trials were not the same as formal experiment .
The fMRI experiment consisted of 4 consecutive scanning runs .
Each run contained 17 stimuli epochs , with 5 for each musical condition and 7 for the control condition .
The sequences of stimuli for the four runs were presented as follows ( p = popular epoch ; a = artistic epoch ; c = control epoch ) : 1 ) c , p , c , a , c , a , c , p , c , a , p , p , a , c , a , p , c ; 2 ) c , p , a , c , a , p , p , a , c , p , c , a , c , a , p , a , c ; 3 ) p , a , c , p , c , a , c , a , p , c , a , a , c , p , c , p , a , c ; 4 ) c , a , p , c , a , c , p , c , p , a , c , a , p , c , p , a , c .
Half of the participants were assigned to the main stimuli sequence ( i.e. , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , and half were assigned to the alternative sequence ( i.e. , 3 , 4 , 1 , 2 ) .
Each run started with a blank lasting for 4 s , and then the music excerpt was presented .
During inter - stimulus interval ( ISI ) , participants had to rate the beauty of each stimulus by pressing the corresponding key .
The duration of ISI was about two thirds of the presentation time of previous stimuli .
The whole experimental run lasted for 420 s without any stimuli during the last 10s .
All participants were asked to close their eyes during each experimental run , and open their eyes during rest .
After the fMRI session , participants were required to rate the following two questions for all stimuli using a 7 - point Likert scale ( response format : 1 = " not at all " ; 4 = " medium " ; 7 = " extremely " ) : A .
The beauty of the music ; and B .
The familiarity of the music .
MRI data were acquired using a 3T whole - body scanner ( Siemens TIM TRIO ) .
Functional images were obtained using a multislice echo plannar imaging ( EPI ) sequence ( 36 slices , slice thickness 3.5 + 0.7 mm gap , TR = 2.2 S , TE = 30ms , field of view = 220 * 220mm 2 , 64 * 64 matrix , flip angle : 90 ° ) .
Scanning slices were aligned approximately parallel to the AP - PC plane , and interval scanning was carried out from the bottom up .
For spatial normalization , a high - resolution T1 - weighted anatomical image was acquired after EPI acquisition , using fast spin echo sequence ( 176 slices , 1 × 1 × 1mm , FOV = 256 * 256mm 2 , TE = 2.43ms , TR = 2530ms ) .
The obtained fMRI data were preprocessed and analyzed using the statistical parametric mapping ( SPM 8 ; Wellcome Trust Center for Imaging , London , UK ; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm ) .
For stabilization of magnetization , the first five volumes of each session were discarded .
Data preprocessing was done with default setting of SPM 8 .
EPI images were co - registered and normalized to the T1 standard template in Montreal Neurological Institute ( MNI ) space ( resampling voxel size : 2 × 2 × 2mm ) , and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with 6 mm FWHM .
After preprocessing , we carried out both factorial model and parametric model analyses [13] .
For the factorial model , first level analysis was performed on each subject by estimating the variance of musical epoch according to a general linear model ( GLM ) .
Three kinds of musical epochs were modeled as separate regressors convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function .
For the parametric model , trials of pop music or artistic music were respectively included into a single regressor , accompanied by a parametric regressor of according post - aesthetic rating .
For both models , six motion parameters estimated during the realignment procedure were included as covariates of no interest .
At the group level , all images were subjected to a voxel - wise contrast and one way ANOVA - within subject analysis to assess statistical significance for the factorial model .
ROI analyses with two sample t - tests were further performed in whole brain clusters showing a significant contract between popular music and artistic music conditions .
Marsbar ( version 0.42 ) was applied to extract the beta value , with spherical ROIs of 10mm radius for putamen , 12mm radius for other areas .
The central location of each ROI was determined by the results of factorial model analysis .
For the parametric analysis , one - sample t - tests were used to reveal the regions in which the BOLD signal correlatively changed with the aesthetic rating scores of popular and artistic music , respectively .
A tow - sample t - test was also used to find out the areas response differently to the rating of the two type of music .
For the above models , global analyses were conducted at a voxel threshold of P < 0.002 ( uncorrected ) , and a cluster threshold of FDR < 0.05 .
Small volume correction ( SVC ) was used , with a 10 mm radius centering a sphere on the coordinate of the ventral striatum peak voxel , and a 12 mm radius centering a sphere on the coordinate of the peak voxels of other regions .
The behavioral data of scanning rating , and post - scanning ratings were analyzed by the One - way ANOVA ( using LSD in post hoc analysis ) via software SPSS 16 .
Twenty - four migratory female blue tits were captured for experiments during the standardized ringing scheme in 2007 at Falsterbo bird observatory [45] located at the south - western tip of Sweden ( 55 ° 23 ’ N , 12 ° 49 ’ E ) .
Swedish blue tits have a south - westerly migratory direction and follow leading coastlines [ 12 , 15 ] .
Due to the location of the ringing station , birds captured at the ringing station are all on migration and about to cross the sea [15] , apart from two breeding pairs of local blue tits that are ringed before the migrants start to arrive .
Only females were selected for the experiment as this is the only sex with considerable migration in both juveniles and adults .
All birds started to feed within an hour after capture and were released with a higher body mass than at capture .
All experimental protocols comply with national legislation and this study was specifically approved by the Malmo / Lund Animal Care committee .
Eight birds each were taken from the bird observatory at three different times during the autumn migration period ; a ) during early migration ( 23rd Sep . ) , b ) during peak migration ( 3rd and 4th Oct . ) , and c ) during late migration ( 13th Oct ) .
Four birds were juveniles ( < 1 year ) and four adults ( > 1 year ) at each time .
Birds were captured between 9.30 AM and 4 PM and immediately ringed and aged [46] .
Wing length , fat score ( following [46] ) and body mass were recorded and birds were then transferred to individual cages ( 0.45 x 0.30 x 0.48 cm ) indoors .
Cages consisted of two upper , outer perches and one lower middle perch , a water suspensor and a feeder at the front of the cage .
Birds were given a mixture of mealworms , Tenebrio sp . and sunflower seeds .
All birds were kept in the same room with natural light patterns .
Birds could hear but not see each other .
Overall , birds were tested five times and then released .
All experiments were video - taped .
Birds were tested in three different experiments between 9.00 to 11.00 AM , except for experiment one which started when the bird was released into the cage .
Either two or six birds were tested at a time due to the arrangement of the cages and availability of only three cameras .
( 1 ) On the day of capture , latency to feed was recorded on release into the cage as an indication of how quickly individuals adapt to their new situation .
( 2 ) Either on day 4 or 5 after capture ( half of the birds , each ) , the bird ’ s neophilia ( attraction to novelty ) was tested by placing a novel object ( red or green pyramid ; 5 x 5 x 3.5 cm ) on one of the upper perches for 30 minutes and recording the latency to touch the object .
The object was placed at a neutral location in the cage that the bird was free to approach or avoid .
In this situation , the novel object elicits approach ( neophilia ) and avoidance ( neophobia ) but in case the bird approaches , neophilia is stronger and a good indicator for an individual ’ s interest in the object [47] .
( 3 ) Birds tested on day 4 on neophilia were tested on neophobia ( avoidance of novelty ) on day 5 and vice versa .
A novel object ( orange or white round cotton mop ; 7 cm in diameter ) was positioned beside the feeder for 60 minutes and the latency to feed was measured .
Additionally , the latency to feed after the same disturbance ( starting of the cameras ) , but without the novel object , was measured on two days ( control latency ) within three days of the neophobia experiment .
In the neophobia experiment , the bird is in a conflict between the motivation to feed and the motivation to avoid the novel object .
The difference in time between feeding with and without the novel object reflects neophobia [47-48] .
Neophilia and neophobia represent two independent motivations [ 47 , 49 - 50 ] and also belong to two different personality dimensions [51-52] .
On day 9 and 10 , all birds were re - tested on the neophobia and neophilia test using the colour that was not used in the previous set - up ( balanced design ) to test for consistency of behaviours over time .
The same object but a different colour was used to keep objects as similar as possible but not identical to avoid habituation [53] and retain novelty [54] .
Five dependent variables were extracted from the experiments ; a ) latency to feed on the capture day , b ) latency to explore ( neophilia ) on the first trial and c ) on the second trial , d ) latency to feed beside the novel object ( neophobia ) on the first trial and e ) on the second trial .
Neophobia latencies were calculated from the average time to feed without the novel object subtracted from the latency to feed with the novel object reflecting the neophobic reaction .
Latency to explore was taken as a proxy for intensity of exploration as these variables were negatively correlated in an earlier study on the same population [35] as was the case in Great tits ( Parus major ) [55] .
Note that a few birds did not feed or explore within the set time limits for experiments , leading to truncation of our data .
For latency to feed on the capture day we used ANOVA with fat ( 0 - 5 with zero indicating no fat ) and wing length as an indicator of size as continuous variables and age ( younger or older than one year ) and migratory season ( early - peak - late migration ) as factors .
We also included the interaction terms age x wing length ( see below ) and age x migratory season to test for differences between age classes along the migratory window .
No three - way interaction terms were included because of the small sample size .
Non - significant terms were removed in a backward elimination process , where main terms were retained if they were included in significant interactions .
Predictor variables were un - correlated , with the exception of adult birds having longer wings ( rp = 0.51 , df = 22 , P = 0.010 ) and a trend for lower fat scores ( rp = - 0.40 , df = 22 , P = 0.054 ) than juvenile birds .
Time of the day at capture did not affect latency to feed ( rp = 0.30 , df = 22 , P = 0.148 ) .
Wing length , indicating the general size of the birds , did not change over season in our sample ( b = 0.2 , t = 1.6 , P = 0.14 ) .
For neophobia and exploration latencies we fitted linear mixed effect models ( LMM ) to consider individual variation with the same independent variables as before .
These models were fitted with REstricted Maximum Likelihood ( REML ) .
ID of the bird was included as a random factor .
Non - significant terms were removed in a backward elimination process , where main terms were retained if they were included in significant interactions .
Interactions were further explored by re - fitting the model and shifting the reference levels of the categorical variables .
Fat and wing length were used to indicate how much body reserves the birds had stored in preparation for migration and as an indicator of general body size , respectively .
Latency to feed , exploration latencies and neophobia were square - root transformed to approach normality .
Because the neophobia data contained negative values ( minimum = - 149.5 ) , we added 150 to all neophobia measurements .
All three variables were also analysed using model selection based on Akaike ’ s Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes , AICc [56] ( see Tables A - C in S1 File ) .
Furthermore , consistency of neophilia and neophobia reactions was tested by comparing the first and second trial using Pearson ’ s correlations .
Finally , we tested for a correlation between latency to feed on the capture day , exploration and neophobia for possible behavioural syndromes by use of Pearson ’ s correlations .
In all correlations , square - root transformed variables were used .
All analyses were conducted in the program R version 3.2.2 [57] , with add - on packages ‘ nlme ’ [58] for mixed effects models .
All birds started to feed within an hour after capture and were released with a higher body mass than at capture .
Experiments conformed to Swedish regulations and were conducted under permit no M237 - 07 .
The study and control groups were identified via the SRPC .
During 2015 , data from 66 % of all deaths in Sweden were gathered by the SRPC [24] .
The SRPC collects data with a web - based end - of - life questionnaire ( ELQ ) , which is completed by healthcare staff after the death of a patient .
Items focus on the last week of life and concern several aspects of the quality of end - of - life care .
The ELQ was developed based on the principles of a good death proposed by the British Geriatrics Society [25] .
Stored data are matched weekly with the central population register for validation purposes [19] .
The validity of the ELQ has been examined in a specialised palliative care setting and was shown to vary between different items , but with overall improvements in an updated version of the ELQ [26,27] .
The SRPC database also contains individual - level information about the cause of death according to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD - 10 ) .
These data are retrieved from the Cause of Death Register at the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare .
Inclusion criteria for the study group were as follows : data were reported to the SRPC , patient deceased during March 2012 to February 2015 , 18 years or older , no forensic port - mortem examination was planned , death was reported as expected and dementia was the underlying cause of death according to the Cause of Death Register .
Exclusion criterion was report of cancer as contributing cause of death in the Cause of Death Register data ( ICD - 10 C00 - D48 , including subcategories ) .
Dementia was classified according to the ICD - 10 ( F00 , F01 , F02 , F03 and G30 , including subgroups ) .
Subgroups of patients with Alzheimer ’ s disease ( ICD - 10 F00 and G30 , including subgroups ) and other and unspecified causes of dementia ( ICD - 10 F01 , F02 and F03 , including subgroups ) were identified .
The control group had the same inclusion criteria as the study group but with cancer as underlying cause of death according to the Cause of Death Register .
Exclusion criterion for the control group was report of dementia as contributing cause of death in the Cause of Death Register data .
Cancer patients were chosen as controls because several studies that have compared end - of - life care quality between patients with cancer and other diseases using SRPC data have shown that patients with cancer generally receive better end - of - life care compared to patients with other diseases [21-23] , thus enabling a comparison with “ best standard ” end - of - life care .
The control group of cancer patients was also chosen because Swedish cancer deaths have better coverage in the SRPC compared to cardiovascular diseases and lung diseases [24] .
The following quality indicators based on items collected by the ELQ in the SRPC database were analysed : documented decision by the responsible physician to shift treatment / care to end - of - life care ; pressure ulcers at death ; assessment of oral health during the last week of life ; someone present at the moment of death ; information to next of kin about transition to end - of - life care ; offer of a follow - up talk to next of kin after death of the patient ; fluids via enteral tube or intravenously during the last 24 hours of life ; assessment of pain and other symptoms during the last week of life ; prescriptions of PRN drugs against pain , anxiety and nausea ; and consultation of a specialised palliative care team during the last week of life .
A robust validity for items about symptom prevalence and symptom alleviation has not been established in the SRPC [27] , and these items were therefore not deemed suitable as quality indicators in this study .
We did not include the item about place of death in line with the patient ’ s last stated wishes because of the uncertain nature of data collection for the dementia group for this item .
We estimated that we would be able to identify at least 800 patients per subgroup and year .
To be able to detect a 5 percentage point difference in the outcomes between subgroups , with significance level below 0.05 and power of 0.8 , the study would require 1600 patients per subgroup .
The study period was set from March 2012 to February 2015 , a period when no changes were made to the ELQ .
Chi - square test ( gender and place of death ) and t - test ( age ) were used to compare groups and subgroups .
The outcomes were dichotomised after exclusion of the “ Don ’ t know ” answers .
When analysing whether a specialised palliative care team was consulted , only patients cared for outside specialised palliative care were included .
Patients with no next of kin were excluded from the analyses regarding next of kin .
The outcomes were then analysed with logistic regression , with cause of death ( dementia vs cancer ) as independent variable .
A model adjusted for age and gender was developed .
A limit of 5 percentage point for clinically significant differences in outcomes between subgroups was chosen .
The working procedure and study design were approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Umea , Sweden ( registration number 2017 / 11 - 31 ) .
The Institutional Review Boards of The Fenway Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved the study procedures .
All participants provided internet - based informed consent .
As all data were analyzed anonymously , documentation of written informed consent was waived by these Institutional Review Boards .
Members of a large , multinational social networking site for MSM were invited to complete an anonymous online survey about PrEP knowledge , interest and experience before ( September - October , 2010 ) and after ( December - January , 2011 ) the release of iPrEx trial data .
At the start of the computer interview , a general description of PrEP was provided to pre - and post - iPrEx groups .
After this description , data were collected on PrEP awareness , interest , and experience .
For the purpose of these analyses , iPrEx results were not provided , since the goal was to capture an unbiased assessment of community norms after public reporting of iPrEx .
Pre - iPrEx , the survey contained 74 items and required approximately 15 - 20 minutes to complete .
Post - iPrEx , 11 additional items ( not included in the current analyses ) were added to the end of the survey , extending the survey by approximately 4 minutes .
Participants were eligible if they were biologically male at birth , at least 18 years of age , HIV - uninfected by self - report , and could read and understand English and use computers and the Internet .
Pre - iPrEx , an email broadcast was sent to the most active United States members ( n = 20 000 ) with an invitation to learn about the study : 13 284 received and opened the emails , 1 790 ( 13.5 % ) clicked through to the survey , 581 ( 32.5 % ) consented to complete a pre - screening questionnaire , 473 ( 81.4 % ) met eligibility criteria , and 398 ( 84.1 % ) consented to enroll in the study and have their data analyzed , representing a 22.2 % response rate of those who clicked on the hyperlink for the study ; 134 ( 33.7 % ) of participants abandoned the study before completion .
Post - iPrEx , another email broadcast was sent with an invitation to learn about the study , and the number of members targeted was increased to include all U.S . members ( excluding those with self - disclosed HIV infection ) given modest enrollment rates from the pre - iPrEx phase : 93 972 members received and opened the emails , 16 715 ( 17.8 % ) clicked through to the survey , 6 267 ( 37.5 % ) consented to complete a pre - screening questionnaire , 5 399 ( 86.1 % ) met eligibility criteria , and 4 558 ( 84.4 % ) consented to enroll in the study and have their data analyzed , representing a 27.3 % response rate ; 1 584 ( 34.8 % ) of participants abandoned the study before completion .
For participants who did not complete the full survey , data were analyzed for all questions that were answered .
As such , the total number of respondents is given for each of the measures reported .
Thirty - seven U.S . states and the District of Columbia were represented pre - iPrEx , and all 50 states and the District of Columbia were represented post - iPrEx .
Participants reported information on demographics and history of sexual partnerships [16] .
To screen for alcoholism , the 4 - item CAGE questionnaire was administered [17] , [18] , [19] .
A score of ≥ 10 on the 10 - item version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression ( CES - D ) scale , a validated survey to assess for depressive symptoms , was considered a positive screen for depression [20] .
Data were collected on prior sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) and high - risk sexual behaviors , including recreational substance use during sex and unprotected anal intercourse with multiple partners or partners who are reportedly HIV - infected or of unknown HIV serostatus .
Self - Perceived Risk of HIV Acquisition : Participants rated their risk on a scale of 1 ( “ Not risky at all ” ) to 10 ( “ Extremely risky ” ) based on their sexual behaviors in the prior 3 months [21] , [22] .
Participants were asked if they had visited a healthcare provider in the prior 12 months and whether they identified a primary care provider ( PCP ) [23] .
To assess communication about HIV risk behaviors , participants were asked to indicate their level of comfort discussing same - sex behaviors with a PCP on a 5 - point scale from 1 ( “ Extremely uncomfortable ” ) to 5 ( “ Extremely comfortable ” ) ; responses were dichotomized for analyses such that a rating of ≤ 3 was categorized as “ Not comfortable ” and ≥ 4 was “ Comfortable ” to provide a conservative estimate of comfort levels .
Participants were also asked if they had discussed unprotected anal sex behaviors or ways to protect themselves against HIV infection with a PCP , based on a prior study focused on patient - provider communication among MSM [23] .
Participants were asked about their awareness and experience with PEP based on questions employed in previous studies conducted at the Fenway Institute [7] , [24] .
PrEP Awareness , Interest , and Experience : Data were collected on PrEP awareness , interest , and experience using questions adapted from a prior study of PrEP attitudes among MSM [7] .
OpenEpi ( Atlanta , GA ) [25] was used to perform t - tests and χ 2 tests of independence , and SAS version 9.2 ( Cary , NC ) was used for descriptive statistics and logistic regression modeling .
Tests were statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level .
Minimal non - independence of respondents contributing to pre - and post - iPrEx samples was presumed given the large difference in sample sizes .
Because data were obtained using different recruitment methods for each sample , descriptive analyses were used instead of formal statistical testing to compare pre - and post - iPrEx results .
The characteristics of participants who completed the survey pre - and post - iPrEx were stratified by awareness of PrEP .
To determine the relationship between participant characteristics and outcomes of interest , bivariate logistic regression procedures were conducted .
Variables significant at P < 0.05 were included in three distinct multivariable models to determine factors that were independently associated with PrEP awareness , interest , and experience .
Multicollinearity was assessed among independent variables .
None of the independent variables were found to be intercorrelated at or above a threshold of 0.80 and all were retained in the final models .
Regression procedures were conducted only on post - iPrEx data , as the substantially larger sample size was more likely to result in meaningful analyses .
We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which we extracted from chart review demographic , epidemiological , co - morbidity , serial clinical and laboratory , radiological , treatment and outcome data from all confirmed adult dengue patients treated using a standardized dengue care path in the Department of Infectious Diseases , Tan Tock Seng Hospital , from 2006 to 2008 .
Prior to admission , patients were mainly referred from primary care centers where the standard is to monitor with full blood count , give symptomatic medication for fever , pain , nausea or diarrhea , and tell the patients to rest and drink copious fluid .
Two groups of laboratory - confirmed dengue cases were considered : ( i ) had positive dengue polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( definite dengue ) [28] ; ( ii ) were positive to dengue immunoglobulin - M ( IgM ) or immunoglobulin - G ( IgG ) ( probable dengue ) ( Dengue Duo IgM & IgG Rapid Strip , Panbio Diagnostic , Queensland , Australia ) .
Patients who were diagnosed with severe dengue at the time of hospital presentation were excluded from further analysis ; patients without SD but with warning signs were included ( Figure 1 ) .
SD cases fulfill at least one of three criteria : ( 1 ) severe plasma leakage : associated with shock ( tachycardia > 100 or narrow pulse pressure < 20 or blood pressure < 90 mmHg ) or respiratory distress , ( 2 ) severe hemorrhage : gastrointestinal tract bleeding such as haemetemesis or melaena or bleeding per rectum , pack cell transfusion or blood transfusion requirement or menorrhagia ( 3 ) severe organ impairment : defined as aspartate or alanine transaminase ≥ 1000units / l , acute renal impairment ( creatinine × 2 upper limit of normal for age and sex ( based on modification of diet in renal disease equation for Glomerular filtration rate = 75 ml / min ) or baseline estimated from minimum creatinine recorded ) , encephalopathy and myocarditis [14] .
In addition , the WHO proposed warning signs suggestive of high risk for SD were recorded : abdominal pain or tenderness , persistent vomiting ( vomiting during two or more consecutive days ) , clinical fluid accumulation , mucosal bleed , lethargy or restlessness , hepatomegaly and concurrent increase in hematocrit and rapid decrease in platelet count ( hematocrit change > = 20 % concurrent with platelet < 50 × 109 / l occurring in the same day ) [14] .

Variables presenting missing data in a proportion greater than 10 % were removed from the analysis .
Those variables with fewer missing data had their missing values replaced by an imputed value being the mean over all individuals in the study .
For dichotomous variables , missing values were imputed by noes , the assumption being that if the sign or symptom were present , it would have been noted by the attending clinician .
Variables that were not clinically relevant to severe dengue ( e.g. runny nose , sore throat ) or that conveyed similar information or information that was a linear combination of other variables were further removed from the analysis .
Variables corresponded to values at presentation with the exception of hematocrit change > = 20 % and drop in platelet count was obtained comparing the value at presentation with values during the course of the disease .
In total , 66 explanatory variables extracted from chart review at presentation were employed and classified in groups : demographic and epidemiological characteristics ; co - morbidities ; symptoms and signs at presentation ; laboratory results at presentation ; and miscellaneous variables ( see the Supporting Information Table S1 for the list of variables considered ) .
Co - morbidities were scored for : congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular disease , chronic pulmonary disease , liver disease , diabetes , hemiplegia , renal disease , malignancy and AIDS .
The scores were combined into the Charlson score and two variables indicating whether the individual had any comorbidity and whether individuals had Charlson score greater than three were respectively created .
The large number of variables allowed us to minimize potential confounders while retaining variables that were clinically relevant .
Prior to the analysis , we further tested the presence of collinear variables using variance inflation factors .
Variables with a variance inflation factor greater than 3 were removed from the analysis stepwise using the package car in the R environment [29] .
Predictive tools for SD development after presentation were constructed using logistic regression or its equivalent generalized linear models ( GLM ) with a logit link function and binomial errors [30] .
Logistic regression or the GLMs used relate a group of explanatory variables to the log of the odds of a patient developing severe dengue versus not developing it .
The GLMs were constructed and simplified using a stepwise procedure that started with the full model and removed one variable at a time using a chi - square test [31] , [32] .
The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve , the area under the ROC curve , sensitivity and specificity of the GLM models were estimated .
Because our aim was to minimize the number of SD cases triaged for outpatient care , while allowing practitioners to decide on the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity , we reported the specificity of the models given high sensitivity rates of 90 % , 95 % and 100 % ( see Figure 2 , for a comparison of the ROC curves ) .
Given the large number of potential predictors and to avoid the risk of overfitting or finding relationships by chance alone , we corrected the estimates of sensitivity and specificity for optimism - decrease in model performance in new patients compared to those in the sample studied [33] .
The bootstrapping method was used to create samples with replacements from the dataset .
A new model repeating all the stepwise model simplification process was constructed .
The performance of the model on the prediction of the bootstrapped sample and the original sample was estimated .
The optimism estimate was the difference between both performances and deducted to the original estimates of sensitivity and specificity [33] .
100 simulations were conducted per model to obtain stable estimates of optimism .
In addition , the models were further validated using 5 - fold validation by which the data are partitioned in 5 subsets , 4 subsets - the training dataset - are used to fit the GLM model and then employed to predict the remaining subset of the data - validation dataset .
The procedure is then repeated changing the subset used as the validation dataset .
The 5 - fold validation process was repeated 1000 times and the mean of the root mean squared prediction error ( RMSPE ) was estimated for each model .
The estimation of RMSPE was also subjected to optimism correction .
Lower RMSPE indicated a better performance in the prediction of new cases and robustness of the model to potential associations found by chance alone .
The R statistical environment was used for all analyses [34] .

This study received ethical approval from the Domain Specific Review Board , National Healthcare Group , Singapore ( DSRB - E / 08 / 567 ) and all data analyzed were anonymized .
Dengue cases were analyzed with and without laboratory information so that appropriate tools could be developed for both well - resourced and resource - limited settings .
GLMs were fitted to six combinations of data and variables : GLM fitted to only PCR confirmed cases including laboratory variables to predict any form of SD.GLM fitted to only PCR confirmed cases excluding laboratory variables to predict any form of SD.GLM fitted to PCR and serology confirmed cases including laboratory variables to predict any form of SD.GLM fitted to PCR and serology confirmed cases excluding laboratory variables to predict any form of SD.GLM fitted to only PCR confirmed cases including laboratory variables to predict severe hemorrhage.GLM fitted to only PCR confirmed cases including laboratory variables to predict severe plasma leakage .
Five healthy volunteers participated in the study ( mean age : 29.4 ± 2.8 years ) .
All participants were right - handed as evaluated by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [42] .
Participants gave their written informed consent prior to the experiment that was conducted in conformity with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience at Maastricht University .
Before the scanning session , participants were trained for half an hour outside the scanner to get familiarized with the motor task .
During the MRI session ( approx . 2 h ) a block design with 20 - s task blocks and alternating 20 - s rest periods was employed .
During task blocks participants were guided by a visual metronome that consisted of a flickering ‘ R ’ on the right side ( indicating right index finger pace ) and a flickering ‘ L ’ on the left side ( indicating left index finger pace ) .
This display was generated using the Presentation software package ( Version 16 , Neurobehavioral Systems Inc . , Albany , CA , USA ) , and was projected onto a mirror mounted in the scanner in front of the participant ’ s head .
During the task blocks of a localization run ( 11 min ) participants were instructed to tap at a medium speed of 2 Hz with their left index finger or their right index finger only .
During the following eight experimental runs ( 11 min each ) the participants performed four different types of tapping sequences , which required an increasing demand on bimanual coordination : 1 ) moving only the right index finger ( unimanual ) , 2 ) moving both index fingers in synchrony ( bimanual synchronous ) , 3 ) moving both index fingers at the same pace in an alternating fashion ( bimanual alternating ) , and 4 ) moving the left index finger in synchrony with the right index finger , but at half of the pace ( bimanual unbalanced ) .
Each of these tapping sequences was performed at four different right - finger tapping speeds ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 Hz ) , which resulted in 16 different experimental conditions ( figure 1 ) .
Eight repetitions per condition were implemented for each participant ( total of 128 task blocks ) , with the order being counterbalanced across the session .
All finger movements during tapping were recorded using a button box , and the software Presentation .
The imaging session concluded with the acquisition of the anatomical images .
The images were acquired at Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre ( Maastricht University ) on a 3T scanner , ( Magnetom Allegra , Siemens Healthcare , Germany ) , equipped with a standard quadrature birdcage head coil .
The participants were placed comfortably in the scanner and their heads were fixed with foam cushions to minimize task - related and other spontaneous motion .
All participants were instructed to avoid any movement other than the finger tapping during scanning .
Functional images were acquired with a repeated single - shot echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence with a relatively short repetition time ( TR = 1000 ms ) , adjusted flip angle ( FA = 62 ° ) , standard echo time ( TE = 30 ms ) , field of view ( FOV = 224 × 224 mm ) , matrix size ( 64 × 64 ) , and 17 slices ( thickness = 4 mm , 1 mm gap ) , resulting in a voxel size of 3.5 × 3.5 × 5 mm 3 , ensuring full coverage of the visual , parietal and motor cortices with limited coverage of prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum .
Anatomical images were collected with a sequence based on the Alzheimer ’ s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ( ADNI ) ( parameters : TR = 2250 ms , TE = 2.6 ms , FA = 9 ° , FOV 256 × 256 mm 2 , 256 × 256 matrix , 192 slices , slice thickness = 1 mm , duration = 8 ∶ 26 min ) .
The behavioral data were analyzed using custom code in MATLAB ( R 2010a ; The MATHWORKS Inc . , Natick , MA , USA ) and SPSS Statistics ( PASW Statistics 18 ; IBM Corporation , Armonk , NY , USA ) .
As the participants ’ instruction was to perform the required order of the left and right button presses as accurately as possible , the following types of errors were defined : a ) unimanual tapping : a button press with the opposite index finger , b ) bimanual synchronous and bimanual unbalanced tapping : a button press that was delayed more than 100 ms in reference to the button press of the opposite index finger , c ) bimanual alternating tapping : each additional consecutive button press .
Secondly , the actual individual tapping speed during each of the 128 task blocks was estimated by computing the inter - response intervals between the responses made with the right index finger .
Both sets of behavioral measures were analyzed using a general linear model with linear contrasts to test for a linear increase along the dimensions of speed and demand on bimanual coordination .
Statistical tests for an increase on demand of bimanual coordination were performed across all tapping sequences , as well as across the three bimanual sequences ( testing for a linear increase from bimanual synchronous to alternating to unbalanced ) .
All tests were performed on group - level ( fixed effects , the individual block measures were concatenated into one data set ) , as well as on single - subject level .
Functional and anatomical images were pre - processed and analyzed using BrainVoyager QX ( Version 2.3 , Brain Innovation B.V . , Maastricht , The Netherlands ) , custom code in MATLAB , and SPSS Statistics .
The first five volumes of each functional run were discarded due to T1 saturation effects .
The data was pre - processed using interscan slice - time correction , 3D rigid - body motion correction , and temporal high - pass filtering with a general linear model ( GLM ) Fourier basis set , and up - sampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm 3 .
Noise artifacts were removed from the data using a linear regression approach .
Estimated head motion parameters ( three translational , three rotational ) to model motion artifacts [28] , [30] , a localized estimate of the white matter signal to model scanner artifacts [29] , and the ventricular signal to model physiological artifacts , were included in the noise model [26] , [27] .
This combination of nuisance regressors has been recommended to be efficient in increasing the specificity [27] , [28] , [30] , as well as the reliability of the results in functional connectivity analysis [31] .
All anatomical and functional data were spatially normalized to Talairach space to enable a comparison between participants [43] .
Group Level Functional Network Analysis : For the functional network analysis , eight a priori regions of interest ( ROIs ) were selected based on the reviewed literature and a meta - analysis on finger tapping [44] ; left and right primary motor cortex ( M1 ) , left and right supplementary motor area ( SMA ) , left and right dorsal premotor cortex ( dPMC ) , left and right visual motion area ( V 5 ) ( figure 2A ) .
All ROIs were defined individually for each participant , based on the data from the localization run , by computing a GLM with the nuisance predictors and task predictors convolved with a standard two - gamma hemodynamic response function .
The ROIs were defined by selecting the 20 most significant functional voxels from the activation cluster closest to the respective coordinates reported in the meta - analysis [44] .
In a second step the average time courses of these ROIs were extracted from the pre - processed and spatially normalized data from the experimental runs .
Pearson ’ s correlation coefficients of the activation - level changes in the selected ROIs were computed block - wise for the 128 experimental task blocks of each individual .
Three different sets of correlations were calculated using three different time windows : 1 ) a wider task window that included task on - and offset responses to measure the overall task connectivity ( 26 - s “ full task ” window , encompassing the rise and decline of the positive BOLD response from 2 seconds after task onset until 28 seconds after , when the decline is expected to level off ) , 2 ) a narrow task window omitting task on - and offset responses to compute the steady - state task connectivity during continuous task performance ( 12 - s “ steady - state ” task window , encompassing only the plateau of the BOLD response from 10 seconds until 22 seconds after task onset , to exclude the initial onset and peak ) , and 3 ) a narrow rest window to measure rest connectivity ( 12 - s “ rest ” window , starting 12s before task onset ) ( figure 2B ) .
Fisher Z transformation was applied to all correlation values to improve the normality of the calculated correlation coefficients [45] .
As a preliminary step to the main analysis on single - subject level , we submitted the block - wise correlations to the same group - level statistical analyses ( fixed effects ) as the behavioral data .

All fMRI - based measures were derived from a network of a priori selected regions of interest ( M1 = primary motor cortex , dPMC = dorsal premotor cortex , SMA = supplementary motor area , V 5 = visual motion area ) , which are depicted schematically in panel A .
The time windows ( grey boxes ) used in the functional connectivity analysis are superimposed on the schematic BOLD responses of the two regions of interest ( solid and dotted line ) in panel B .
Based on the group - level analysis , the functional connection showing the strongest task modulation was selected in order to further investigate the feasibility of using functional connectivity measures as a neurofeedback measure on a single - subject level .
Visual inspection of the single - block blood oxygenation level - dependent ( BOLD ) responses from the selected ROIs confirmed that the steady - state task - and rest - connectivity ( 12 - s steady - state task window and 12 - s rest window ) were not contaminated by the task on - and offset responses .
For the block - wise correlations the same statistical analyses as performed at the group - level were repeated at the single - subject level .
Additionally , block - wise activation level measures were computed for all 128 task blocks ( % signal change 12 - s task vs . 12 - s rest ) , and submitted to the same statistical analysis .
Furthermore , we investigated two different types of brain - behavior link .
First , to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the computed brain measures to detect if a task was performed uni - or bimanually , we set the intermediate value between the means from both types of tasks as a threshold .
We then computed how well the actually performed task could be detected based on the single - block brain measures using this simple threshold approach ( chance level being 50 % ) .
We tested for significance through paired t - tests .
Second , to estimate the criterion validity of the brain measures for indicating which tapping speed was performed , we correlated the block - wise brain measures with the block - wise actual finger tapping speed .
We tested for the significance of this correlation through linear regression .
Finally , to directly test for differences between the different sets of functional connectivity and activation level - based measures statistically , we submitted them pairwise to a three - way ( measure × tapping speed × demand on bimanual coordination ) analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) for repeated measures on group ( fixed effects ) and single - subject level .
The present investigation is a cross - sectional analysis on baseline data within the frame of the PREDIMED - PLUS study , a 6 - year multicenter , randomized , parallel - group , primary prevention clinical trial conducted in Spain to assess the effect on CVD morbimortality of an intensive weight loss intervention program based on an energy - restricted traditional Mediterranean diet , PA promotion and behavioral support , in comparison with an usual care intervention only with energy - unrestricted Mediterranean diet ( control group ) .
A more detailed description of the PREDIMED - PLUS study is available at http://predimedplus.com/ .
This study was registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial ( ISRCT ; http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89898870 ) with number 89898870 .
Registration date : 24 July 2014 .
From October 2013 to October 2016 , a total of 5776 participants were recruited and randomized in 22 centres from different universities , hospitals and research institutes of Spain .
Each of these centres recruited participants from several Primary Care Health Facilities belonging to the National Health System .
The eligible participants were community - dwelling adults ( aged 55 - 75 in men ; 60 - 75 in women ) with overweight / obesity [ body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 27 and < 40 kg / m2 ] , who met at least three components of the MetS according to the updated harmonized criteria of the International Diabetes Federation and the American Heart Association and National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute [32] .
All participants included in the current analysis presented data on PA , sedentary behaviors and sleeping time .
All participants provided written informed consent , and the study protocol and procedures were approved according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki by all the participating institutions : CEI Provincial de Malaga , CEI de los Hospitales Universitarios Virgen Macarena y Virgen del Rocio , CEI de la Universidad de Navarra , CEI de las Illes Balears , CEIC del Hospital Clinic de Barcelona , CEIC del Parc de Salut Mar , CEIC del Hospital Universitari Sant Joan de Reus , CEI del Hospital Universitario San Cecilio , CEIC de la Fundacion Jimenez Diaz , CEIC Euskadi , CEI en Humanos de la Universidad de Valencia , CEIC del Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Doctor Negrin , CEIC del Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge , CEI de Cordoba , CEI de Instituto Madrileno De Estudios Avanzados , CEIC del Hospital Clinico San Carlos , CEI Provincial de Malaga , CEI de las Illes Balears , CCEI de la Investigacion Biomedica de Andalucia and CEIC de Leon .
Sedentary behaviours were evaluated on weekdays and weekends with the validated Nurses ’ Health Study questionnaire for sedentary behaviours [33] , consisting of a set of open - ended questions assessing the average daily time spent over the last year in watching TV , sitting while using computer , sitting on journeys ( for work purposes or leisure time , as driver or passenger car , subway , bus , etc ) and total sitting .
Answers included 12 categories ranging from 0 to ≥ 9 h / day of sitting time for the corresponding activity .
Because TV time is the most prevalent sedentary behavior , for which previous investigations among aged population have suggested to fairly capture total sedentary time [34] and to consistently associate to higher risk of various cardiometabolic risk factors and cardiovascular mortality in a dose - response fashion [8] , the present study has evaluated TV time as a proxy for sedentary behaviors .
Leisure - time PA was assessed using the validated REGICOR questionnaire [35] ( including questions to collect information the type of activity , frequency ( number of days ) and duration ( min / day ) .
The intensity was assigned based on the compendium of PA [36] .
A trained interviewer collected the required information about 6 types of activities performed during a conventional month : brisk walking ( 5 MET ) , walking at a slow / normal pace ( 4 MET ) , walking in the countryside ( 6 MET ) , climbing stairs ( 7 MET ) , working in the garden ( 5 MET ) , exercise or play sports at home , outdoors or in a gym ( 11 MET ) .
According to PA intensity , activities were categorized into light PA < 4.0 MET , moderate PA 4 - 5.5 MET and vigorous PA ≥ 6.0 MET .
Total leisure - time PA - related energy expenditure was estimated as the summed product of frequency , duration and intensity of each activity divided by 30 days / month ( MET · min / day ) .
For the present study , leisure - time PA was categorized in light PA ( including leisurely stroll or walk ) and MVPA ( including the sum for any activity of moderate or greater intensity ) .
Finally , PA time was computed as the sum of frequency * duration of each activity divided by 30 to obtain the number of min / day .
Regarding sleep , participants reported their average daily sleeping time for both weekdays and weekends , using the non - validated open question “ How many hours do you sleep on average per day on weekdays and weekends ? ”
Study outcomes were obesity , T2D and individual components of the MetS .
Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg / m2 .
T2D was defined as previous clinical diagnosis of diabetes , or HbA1c levels ≥ 6.5 % or use of antidiabetic medication at baseline .
Individual components of the MetS were defined as follows : abdominal obesity ( waist circumference ≥ 102 cm in men ; ≥ 88 cm in women ) , high blood pressure ( systolic and / or diastolic ≥ 130 / 85 mmHg or using antihypertensive drugs ) , hyperglycaemia ( glucose ≥ 5.5 mmol / L or taking medication for elevated glucose ) , hypertriglyceridemia ( triglycerides ≥ 1.7 mmol / L or taking triglyceride - lowering medication ) , low HDL - cholesterol ( HDL - c < 1.03 mmol / L in men and < 1.3 mmol / L in women or taking HDL - c raising medication ) [32] .
The covariates were evaluated using self - reported questionnaires about socio - demographic factors ( sex , age , education , and marital and employment status ) , smoking habits , personal and family history of illness , medical conditions , medication use and a 17 - item screening questionnaire assessing adherence to an energy - restricted Mediterranean diet .
Anthropometric variables and blood pressure were determined by trained staff and in accordance with the PREDIMED - PLUS operations protocol .
Weight and height were measured with calibrated scales and a wall - mounted stadiometer , respectively .
BMI was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared .
Waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest , after normal exhalation , using an anthropometric tape .
Blood pressure was measured in triplicate with the use of a validated semiautomatic oscillometer ( Omron HEM - 705CP , Netherlands ) while the participant was in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest .
Blood samples were collected after 12 hours overnight fast and biochemical analyses were performed on fasting plasma glucose , HDL - c and triglycerides concentrations in local laboratories using standard enzymatic methods .
In order to provide with more detailed information , baseline characteristics are presented according to categories of total leisure - time PA in min / day ( < 15 , from 15 to < 30 , from 30 to < 60 , from 60 to < 120 and ≥ 120 ) as means ± SD and number ( % ) by using one - way ANOVA or chi - square tests as appropriate .
Given the cross - sectional design , Cox regression models with constant time of follow - up for all individuals and robust variance estimates were fitted to estimate RR and 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) for each study outcome ( obesity , T2D , and individual components of the MetS , all as dichotomous variables ) per 1 - h / day increase in time spent in each activity separately ( TV - viewing , light PA and MVPA and sleeping , all as continuous variables ) .
Correspondingly , the time t was set to a constant ( t = 1 ) .
According to methodologists , this model is better suited than logistic regression for cross - sectional studies with frequent prevalent outcomes , such as the present study , since it avoids the overestimation of the prevalence ratios derived from the odds ratios when logistic regression is applied in analysis with frequent outcomes [37,38] .
A crude model and three multivarible - adjusted Cox regression models were fitted as follows : a ) model 1 [ adjusted for age ( continuous ) , sex , education level ( illiterate / primary education , secondary education and academic / graduate ) , smoking status ( never smoker , past smoker and current smoker ) , marital status ( single / divorced , married and widower ) , family history of coronary heart disease ( yes or no ) and energy - restricted Mediterranean diet adherence ( score 0 to 17 items , in categories of < 8 or ≥ 9 items ) ] , b ) model 2 [ model 1 plus the time spent on the rest of the activities to precisely assess the independent effect of an activity ] and c ) model 3 [ model 2 plus each of the other components of the MetS , only for the associations with each component of the MetS ] .
All models were stratified by recruiting center .
In order to correct for multiple testing , the Benjamini - Hochberg approach was applied to calculate false discovery rate q values [39] .
Effect modification by sex , age ( ≤ 65 , > 65 years ) and the exposure variables ( time spent in sleeping time , TV - viewing , light PA and MVPA ) on each outcome was evaluated by calculating te likelihood ratio test between the fully adjusted model and the same model adding the interaction product - term .
All analysis testing for effect modifications by sex and age showed no statistical significance ( P > .40 for all interactions ) .
Taking advantage of the interpretation and the relevance to public health recommendations , we employed isotemporal substitution modeling to estimate the theoretical association of replacing 1 - h / day from one activity for 1 - h / day of another activity on the prevalence of each outcome , adjusting for potential confounders as detailed previously in models 2 and 3 .
For these analyses , all activity variables ( e.g. , time spent in TV - viewing , light PA , and MVPA ) , except the activity of interest which was dropped ( e.g. , sleeping time ) , were entered simultaneously into the models , along with a total discretionary time and covariates as follows : h ( t ) = h0 ( t ) exp [ β 1 ( TV - viewing ) + β 2 ( light PA ) + β 3 ( MVPA ) + β 4 ( total discretionary time ) + β 5 ( covariates ) ] , where t = 1 .
Total discretionary time was computed as a result of the sum of hours spent in TV - viewing , light PA , MVPA and sleeping .
Therefore , it is assumed that the model was isotemporal when including the total discretionary time variable herein .
Thus , the Cox regression estimates for the included activities variables reflects the RR for each outcome observed when the time spent in these activities increases 1 - h / day because the time spent in the omitted activity ( e.g. , sleeping ) decreases 1 - h / day .
Finally , because PA and TV - viewing are two closely - related lifestyle behaviours concerning to cadiometabolic outcomes such as obesity and T2D [40] we explored the joint associations of combining MVPA and time spent watching TV on obesity and T2D .
For this purpose , MVPA was first dichotomized into meeting or not meeting current WHO recommendations [41] for MVPA set in ≥ 2.5 h / week ( yes / no ) .
Time spent in watching TV ( in hours ) was categorized in three approximately equally distributed groups : low TV ( ≤ 2h / day ) , medium TV ( > 2 to ≤ 4h / day ) and high TV ( > 4h / day ) .
Therefore , each participant was cross - allocated to one of the six joint categories and meeting MVPA recommendations and low TV group was considered as the reference category .
The interaction between meeting or not meeting the recommendations for MVPA and time spent watching TV in their associations with each outcome was examined by calculating the likelihood ratio test between the fully adjusted model and the same model including the interaction product - term ( P > .30 for all the interactions ) .
Significance for all statistical tests was P < .05 for bilateral contrast .
All analyses were cross - sectional , and performed using Stata ( 14.0 , StataCorp LP , Tx . USA ) .
The Adolescent Nutritional Assessment Longitudinal Study ( ELANA ) followed two cohorts ( middle and high school ) at two public and four private schools from the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
The metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro is formed by 18 municipalities representing the second largest centre of national wealth in the country [23] .
In contrast , the geographic area of ELANA ’ s schools faces many social disparities which results in a lack of security and vulnerable neighbourhoods and poverty [24] .
The main aim of the ELANA was to examine changes in anthropometric indicators and body composition , and to verify the influence of health , socioeconomic and psychosocial factors on inadequate development and nutritional status .
This study included data from the middle school cohort from 2010 to 2012 .
At baseline , a self - reported questionnaire was administered to investigate physical activity , sedentary behaviour , socioeconomic and demographic variables among the adolescents .
Questionnaire of physical activity was repeated in 2011 , and sedentary behaviours in 2011 and 2012 .
This research was conducted according to the guidelines established in the Declaration of Helsinki .
The Ethics Committee of Research of the Institute of Social Medicine of the State University of Rio de Janeiro ( certificate number 0020.0.259.000 - 09 ) approved all procedures involving human subjects before the start of the study .
Adolescents ’ legal guardians provided a written informed consent .
All the data we used were confidential and the researchers did not have access to any personal data that could identify individuals included in the study .
Following the internal regulations of the ELANA Study committee , data are made available for specific research projects .
Thus , we are not allowed to share the data we used for this study with other researchers .
However , we are glad to answer questions about the data used in this study and to share unpublished results .
Out of the 946 adolescents available , 888 met the eligibility criteria for this study , which included not having a physical or mental condition preventing the completion of questionnaires and / or not being pregnant or lactating at the time of data collection .
Of the 888 eligible adolescents , 32 ( 3.6 % ) refused to participate , 46 ( 5.2 % ) did not have parental consent , and 4 ( 0.45 % ) had no birth date information .
The study sample comprised 810 students at baseline , of which 786 adolescents completed information of physical activity and sedentary behaviours at baseline , corresponding to a response rate of 88.5 % .
In 2011 , 526 students repeated the evaluation of physical activity and sedentary behaviours ( 33 % missing cases ) , and 435 of sedentary behaviours in 2012 ( 46 % missing cases ) .
Imputation of missing cases was carried out by means of maximum likelihood estimation , allowing the study to include 810 adolescents in all time points .
Physical activity ( PA ) was assessed by the short version of the self - reported ‘ International Physical Activity Questionnaire - IPAQ ’ which has eight open questions estimating the weekly time of vary intensities of PA during the last 7 days ( light PA : walking ; moderate PA : carrying light loads , bicycling at a regular pace , or doubles tennis ; and vigorous PA : lifting , digging , aerobics , or fast bicycling ) .
This questionnaire was validated by Guedes et al . ( 2005 ) [25] for Brazilian adolescents older than 14 years old .
The Brazilian version of short IPAQ has been validated against a 24 - hour recall instrument of the daily activities , identifying correlation coefficients varying between 0.49 to 0.83 .
When detecting blank answers and unusual values for responses ( e.g. the adolescent said they performed eight hours of MVPA per day ) the research staff returned to the student in order to check the coherence of the answer , avoiding loss of information and classification errors .
The time ( in minutes ) of light PA and MVPA per day was used , and it was based on the guidelines for data processing and analyses of the IPAQ [26] .
The television viewing ( TV ) and video game / computer use ( VG ) times were assessed separately by two questions from a self - reported questionnaire [27] .
The first question was ‘ How many days do you watch TV and use VG per week ? ( 1 ) Almost never or never , ( 2 ) 1 to 2 times per week , ( 3 ) 3 to 4 times per week , ( 4 ) 5 to 6 times per week , and ( 5 ) every day ’ .
The responses were categorised in a five - point scale : category 1 = 0 days ( almost never or never ) , 2 = 1.5 days , 3 = 3.5 days , 4 = 5.5 days , 5 = 7 days .
The second question was ‘ In general , how many hours do you usually spend watching TV and using VG per day ? ’ .
Average daily time in minutes was calculated multiplying ‘ hours per day ’ by ‘ days per week ’ for TV and VG variables , applying the formula : [ ( days per week ) * ( hours per day ) ] * 60 / 7 .
Age , Asset ownership , body mass index ( BMI ) and sexual maturation were treat as potential baseline confounders of the investigated association .
The economic characteristics of the families of the adolescents were assessed through the Brazilian Socioeconomic Classification Criteria ( CCEB ) [28] , which takes into account the purchasing power of urban households based on a score obtained by the sum of the household assets , the presence of domestic workers in the household and the schooling level of the head of household .
An indicator constructed from information on ownership of durable assets in the home was used to calculate the presence or absence of , respectively : TV ; VCR or DVD player ; radio ; bathroom ; automobile ; washing machine ; refrigerator ; and freezer ( independent appliance or part of duplex refrigerator ) .
A weighted score was attributed considering presence and relative frequency of each item [29] .
The Body mass index ( BMI in kg / m2 ) was calculated based on direct measurements of height and weight [30] .
Sexual maturation stage was investigated using the self - evaluation technique validated by Saito ( 1984 ) [31] , focusing on the development of genitalia for boys and breast for girls , according to Tanner ’ s ( 1962 ) [32] criteria .
This information was coded as a categorical variable ( pre - pubescent , early spurt , maximum speed peak , and slowing growth ) .
Firstly , the distribution of all variables in the sample was tested by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test .
Comparisons between the genders were performed through the non - parametric Wilcoxon Test , and Wilcoxon Rank Compared Test to evaluate differences between means ranks over time from T1 to T2 .
In order to facilitate the interpretation of the descriptive results , we presented means , standard deviations , minimum and maximum , previously tested and that showed similar statistical results with non - parametric tests ( p values ) ( details available upon request ) .
Due to the non - normal distribution of the sample , an asymptotic estimation ( more appropriate for non - parametric distributions , without missing value imputation ) was performed instead of the maximum likelihood missing values estimation .
All coefficient values remained similar in this analysis , but lost their statistical significance , most likely due to the decreased sample size .
Hence , it was decided to continue the analysis with the maximum likelihood for missing values estimation .
The maximum likelihood estimation was used to deal with missing values , which is probably the most pragmatic missing data estimation approach for structural equation modelling ( SEM ) , and has been shown to produce unbiased parameter estimates and standard errors for data missing at random and data missing completely at random [33] .
School changes by students are very common in Brazil , making it difficult to follow them , and these are probably not related to the outcomes or the other variables being investigated .
Further sensitivity analysis was performed to support the assumption of missing at random or completely random for the imputation process ( available upon request ) .
Autoregressive cross - lagged panel models were estimated by means of SEM to simultaneously address bidirectional association of PA and screen activities , with maximum likelihood missing values estimation .
Two different models were performed , considering the intensities of PA [ Model A : light PA ; Model B : MVPA , both stratified by gender .
A baseline model was constructed with autoregressive paths ( measuring stability over time ) from light PA and MVPA ( Models A and B , respectively ) at Time 1 ( T1 - 2010 ) to Time 2 ( T2 - 2011 ) , and from screen activities ( TV and VG ) at T1 to T2 , and from T2 to Time 3 ( T3 - 2012 ) .
The autoregressive model also included correlations between PA ( light PA : model A and MVPA : model B ) and screen activities at T1 and T2 ; and within screen activities ( TV and VG ) at T3 .
Apart from the baseline model , three additional models were assessed which included one or more cross - lagged estimate ( I . Forward causation model : PA at T1 predicts screen activities at T2 ; II . Reversed causation model : screen activities at T1 predict PA at T2 ; III . Reciprocal model : PA and screen activities have reciprocal effects ) .
Baseline confounders were included in all models but not shown in illustrations .
The models were illustrated in Fig 1 ( 1a [ Model A ] and 1b [ Model B ] ) .

The Adolescent Nutritional Assessment Longitudinal Study , 2010 - 2012 , Brazil .
For each of the models ( A and B ) , a set of model fit statistics was derived : the Standardised Root Mean Square Residual ( RMSEA ) , which should be below or close to 0.06 , as well as the Comparative Fit Index ( CFI ) and the Tucker - Lewis Index ( TLI ) , which should both be close to or above 0.95 .
The p value for chi - square test was also presented for the model fit statistics , which should be above 0.05 .
Age , BMI , asset ownership and sexual maturation were used in the models as confounding variables assessed at baseline ( suppressed on the Fig 1a and 1b [ methods ] , and Figs 2 and 3 [ results ] .
All analyses were performed in Stata version 13.1 ( Stata Corp , Texas , USA ) .

The Adolescent Nutritional Assessment Longitudinal Study , 2010 - 2012 , Brazil .
Data were collected in an online survey , which was advertised as “ Win three tickets for the Sziget Festival with your habits ” and appeared on Hungarian general news and magazine websites .
Participants were entered into a price drawing where three incentives ( valued at € 900 ) were offered .
Participants could reach the survey between January and August 2014 .
Only individuals older than 18 years could take part .
In total , 4177 people participated in the online questionnaire .
Data were used if at least 80 % of the items were completed , leaving 2875 valid responses .
Despite our call , 170 participants were under 18 years old and were consequently excluded .
This left 2705 participants ’ data for analysis .
Out of these , 1026 ( 36 % ) intentionally pulled their hair , 2289 ( 85 % ) bit their nails and 1198 ( 44 % ) intentionally picked their skin at least once during their life .
Only those participants who reported to have done the given behaviour at least once were offered to fill out the appropriate grooming questionnaire .
TTM was assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale ( MGH - HPS ) .
The most widely used TTM instrument , the MGH - HPS is based on the Yale - Brown Obsessive - Compulsive Scale ( Y - BOCS ) [44] .
The MGH - HPS has previously demonstrated strong test - retest reliability ( r = 0.97 ) [45] .
The questionnaire is self - administered , and participants rate severity , urge to pull , actual pulling , perceived control and associated distress from 0 ( no symptom ) to 4 ( extreme symptom ) on a five - point summative response scale .
The items were translated and back - translated from English to Hungarian by three independent experts of both languages .
The questionnaire provides an estimate of symptom severity in the past seven days .
Internal consistency was high in the current sample ( α = 0.92 ) .
Similar to the MGH - HPS , the Skin Picking Scale - Revised ( SPS ) was also modelled after the Y - BOCS [10] .
The SPS contains eight factors covering impairment and symptom severity .
The instrument demonstrated acceptable internal consistency in the current sample ( α = 0.88 ) .
Considering the lack of clinically adapted nail - biting questionnaires in the literature and in order to comply with the previous questionnaires used in the current study ( the MGH - HPS and SPS ) , we adapted the SPS to measure the severity of NB .
The NB scale ( NBS ) performed acceptable internal consistency ( α = 0.77 ) and can be found in the S1 File .
Impulsivity was measured by the modified Barratt Impulsiveness Scale ( BIS [46] , ) .
The 21 - item questionnaire has three first - order factors : self - control , impulsive behaviour and impatience .
Items are rated 1 to 4 .
The BIS achieved an acceptable level of internal consistency : α = 0.81 .
The Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI ) is a 53 - item self - report measurement designed to evaluate psychopathology in nine major fields of psychiatry : depression , anxiety , hostility , obsessive - compulsive tendencies , somatisation , phobic anxiety , psychoticism and paranoid ideation [47] .
Besides the nine basic dimensions , the Global Severity Index calculates the sum of the scales and four extra items , then divides the sum by the total number of items to which the individual responded .
The items are rated on a five - point summative response scale from 0 ( not at all ) to 4 ( very much ) .
The scale was validated in Hungarian [48] and yielded high internal consistency ( α = 0.96 ) .
The Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder ( ZAN - BPD ) adapted the BPD criteria from the DSM - IV [49] .
Initially developed for clinical use , the instrument was adopted to be used as a self - report measure with nine items .
The ZAN - BPD reflects a one - week timeframe , and each of the nine criteria for BPD is rated to be present or absent .
The scale had acceptable internal consistency ( Cronbach ’ s α = 0.72 ) .
Contingent self - esteem ( CSE ) refers to the external sources of a person ’ s perceived self - worth , such as others ’ love and evaluation of competence [50] .
Sample items are “ I feel worthwhile only when I have performed well ” or “ I tend to suppress my own needs and emotions to make others feel good ” .
The 26 items assessing CSE are measured on a scale from 1 to 4 , with higher scores indicating increased likelihood to base one ’ s self - esteem on others ’ evaluation .
CSE contains two subscales , competence - based and relation - based self - esteem .
The scale was translated to Hungarian in the same way as the MGH - HPS .
Cronbach ’ s alpha was 0.93 .
Confirmatory factor analysis with Mplus version 7.3 [51] was used to estimate the degree of fit for each grooming measure ( TTM , SP and NB ) .
Four models were tested .
Model 1 consisted of correlating first - order factors ( TTM , SP and NB defined as latent factors ) .
Model 2 included a hierarchical factor structure representing the general grooming dimension as defined by the three first - order latent factors .
Model 3 was a bifactorial model with the three first - order factors and the general latent factor defined by all grooming items .
In this model , the correlation between the specific factors and the correlations between the specific factors and the global factor were fixed to zero [52] .
Finally , Model 4 was bifactorial with correlating first - order factors .
Due to the severe floor effect in the responses , items were treated as ordinal indicators , and the weighted least squares mean and variance ( WLSMV ) adjusted estimation method was used [ 53 , 54 ] .
A satisfactory degree of fit requires the comparative fit index ( CFI ) and the Tucker - Lewis index ( TLI ) to be higher than or close to 0.95 , and the model should be rejected when these indices are less than 0.90 [ 53 , 55 ] .
The next fit index was the root mean square error of approximation ( RMSEA ) .
RMSEA below 0.05 indicates an excellent fit , a value around 0.08 indicates an adequate fit and a value above 0.10 indicates a poor fit .
Closeness of the model fit using RMSEA ( CFit of RMSEA ) is a statistical test , which evaluates the statistical deviation of RMSEA from the value 0.05 [53] .
A nonsignificant probability value ( p > 0.05 ) indicates an acceptable model fit .
Missing data was excluded listwise .
The multiple indicators and multiple causes ( MIMIC ) modelling technique , a specification of structural equation modelling , was chosen for the present study [56] .
We opted for this technique because MIMIC models can estimate the effect of indicators on latent variables when the direct effects of continuous variables on the latent variables are also included .
In addition , MIMIC modelling is suitable to validate a construct via reflective modelling [57] .
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Eotvos Lorand University and conforms to the Declarations of Helsinki .
All participants were informed about the purpose of the study and provided written consent before filling out the questionnaire .
Participants of the current study were 4513 children from rural areas in Yancheng , China .
Before we conducted our study , we sent our study proposal to all primary and middle schools in rural areas in Yancheng , including 55 primary schools and 67 middle schools .
Yancheng , is an area that is relatively backward in economy in Jiangsu Province , China and many adults in rural areas in Yancheng had migrated to cities to seek livelihoods , with their children left at home .
Nineteen schools , including 12 primary schools and 7 middle schools responded and agreed to help coordinate recruiting participants in their schools for our study .
Under the schoolteachers ’ help , our researchers went to all classes from Grade 3 to Grade 9 in each school , expressing the study purpose to the students and letting the students to bring the consent form to their guardians .
We excluded students under Grade 3 because these students did not have the basic reading ability to answer our questionnaire .
We had also excluded the children who had mental deficiencies based on the information provided by the schoolteachers .
The participation of our study was entirely voluntary .
We involved the students as our participants only after we got the signature of their guardians and their own .
Response rates in the 19 schools ranged from 82.7 % to 96.3 % .
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Normal University ( China ) .
Finally , 4513 children participated in our study .
Ages of the participants were from 9 to 17 years old ( M = 12.38 ) .
Among these children , 8.3 % were at Grade 3 , 17.7 % were at Grade 4 , 18.1 % were at Grade 5 , 17.3 % were at Grade 6 , 16.0 % were at Grade 7 , 13.5 % were at Grade 8 , and 8.6 % were at Grade 9 students .
Moreover , 52.7 % children were females and 47.3 % were males .
Among the children that participated in the current study , there were 2416 ( 53.5 % ) non - left - behind children and 1997 ( 46.5 % ) left - behind children .
Furthermore , among the left - behind children , 1003 children were living only with mother ( father absence group ) , 132 were living only with father ( mother absence group ) , 962 were living without the care of either parent ( both - parents absence group ) .
All participants responded to a questionnaire comprised of a ) a range of questions concerning demographic information , including age , gender , school , grade , social economic status ( SES ) , and the status of parental presence , b ) the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children ( CES - DC ) [17] , c ) the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children ( MASC ) [18] , d ) a question regarding respondents ’ suicide ideation .
The SES of children was assessed by asking the children that which financial level of their family was at in comparison with fellow students - lower than average , average , or higher than average [19] .
To detect the suicide ideation , children were asked by one question that whether or not they had the thoughts of killing themselves in the past two weeks [20-21] .
All the inventories used in our study were translated into Chinese before being administered to participants .
We performed the translation and back - translation process to ensure that the contents of the inventories were accurately translated ( see S1 File for our Chinese version questionnaire ) .
The study utilized the CES - DC to evaluate children ’ s depression level [17] .
The CES - DC has 20 items and all times are scored by a 4 - point Likert scale , with 1 indicating “ not at all ” and 4 indicating “ a lot ” .
Examples of the items are : “ during the past one week , I felt like I was too tired to do things ” and “ during the past one week , I had a good time ( reversely scored ) ” .
The inventory was a uni - dimentional scale and the higher scores represents increasing level of depression .
The CES - DS has been broadly adopted in previous empirical studies and been reported with satisfactory psychometric properties [22-24] .
In the current study , the reliability of the inventory was .87 .
The MASC was adopted to test children ’ s status of anxiety [18] .
The MASC consists of 39 items , which are divided into four subscales - social anxiety , harm avoidance , isolation anxiety , and physical anxiety .
Examples of items are : “ I worry about other people laughing at me ” ( social anxiety ) , “ I get scared when my parents go away ” ( isolation anxiety ) , “ I try to do everything exactly right ” ( harm avoidance ) , and “ I get dizzy or faint feelings ” ( physical anxiety ) .
The MASC has been widely adopted to test the anxiety status of children in empirical studies and been validated across cultures [ 18 , 25 - 26 ] .
In the current study , the four - dimension structure of the MASC was further validated by exploratory factor analysis .
It was found that items corresponding to the six types of anxieties were successfully identified from the MASC and the four factors accounted for 47.95 % variance in the data .
Furthermore , the reliabilities of the inventory were .83 , .65 , .71 , and .87 , respectively , for the subscales of social anxiety , harm avoidance , isolation anxiety , and physical anxiety .
With respect to data analyses , first , psychometric properties the CES - DC and the MASC were evaluated by exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach ’ s alpha test .
Second , descriptive statistics were carried out to investigate the statistical distributions of the continuous variables ( e.g. , depression , social anxiety , harm avoidance ) and to test the prevalence of suicide ideation among children with different status of parental absence .
Third , logistic regression was conducted to test the relationship between parental - absence status and suicide ideations with demographic factors being controlled .
Fourth , ANOVA and post hoc analyses with Bonferroni correction were performed to examine the difference of depression and anxiety levels across children with different parental - absence status .
Fifth , simple mediation models were established for evaluating the roles of depression and anxiety in the association of parental - absence status to suicide ideation [27-28] .
All data analyses were performed in SPSS 19 .
The SPSS PROCESS was utilized particularly to test the indirect effects of parental - absence status to suicide ideation through depression or anxiety [28] .
We use data from the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey ( DHS ) for this analysis .
The DHS was collected under the guidance of Population Division , Ministry of Health and Population of the Government of Nepal and with technical assistance from ICF International .
The DHS is a nationally representative household survey of women of reproductive age , defined as 15 - 49 years of age , conducted every 5 years using a stratified , two stage cluster design with a 97.6 % response rate in 2011 [28] .
It has household level as well as individual level modules for men and women .
For this analysis we link the household level and individual women ’ s modules .
The household module ( which includes the household food insecurity questions ) was answered by the household head and the individual women ’ s module was answered by selected women of reproductive age in that household .
A total of 12,674 women were interviewed in 2011 .
For this analysis , the sample is limited to currently married , non - pregnant women with at least one living child .
Since one of the main variables of interest is household structure , we focus on married women who are living in different types of co - resident structures .
Non - married women would likely have very different household structures and be subjected to different roles in their households .
We limit the sample to non - pregnant women since family planning use is not relevant among pregnant women .
Additionally , different norms are likely to apply to pregnant women ’ s access to food .
We also restrict the sample to women who had at least one living child , since family planning use before the first child is born is very low in this setting .
A total of 7,459 women have no missing data and fit these criteria .
Two primary factors potentially associated with the outcome of interest ( family planning use ) are explored in this analysis .
The first is the household co - residence structure in which the woman lived .
This variable is created by grouping women by household ID in the Nepal DHS data , since more than one woman of reproductive age per household was eligible to participate in the survey .
Then , based on whether or not more than one woman in the household was included in the sample , and combined with information from the question “ What is your relationship to the household head ? ”
we categorize women into the following four groups : Group 1 includes women who were not co - residing , defined as women who reported that they were married to the head of the household or were the head of the household and were not living with another woman of reproductive age in the household , nor with a mother - in law .
These women are the referent group as we assume them to be the highest status group .
Group 2 includes woman living in a household with in - laws , but no sister - in - laws who took the survey .
Group 3 includes women living in household where there was at least one other woman in the same household , and their husband was older than the other woman ’ s husband .
This is the “ elder ” sister category .
Group 4 includes women living with at least one other woman from the survey in the same household , and the husband being younger than the husband of the other woman in the household .
If more than two women were included in the survey who lived in the same household , then the one with the oldest husband was in group three and all of the younger ones in group 4 ( Fig 2 ) .
We hypothesize that Group 4 women have the lowest status in the household , and Group 1 the highest , however , it is unclear whether elder ( Group 3 ) women or women with no sisters - in - law ( Group 2 ) would be of higher status .

The second factor of interest is household level food insecurity .
Food insecurity was measured using the household food insecurity access scale collected in the 2011 Nepal DHS [28] .
The 2011 Nepal DHS asked 7 of the 9 questions in Household Food Insecurity Access Scale indicators developed in USAID ’ s Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance ( FANTA ) project [33] .
These questions were modified to be culturally relevant to Nepal and the time frame was expanded to 12 months ( from the standard 1 month ) because of seasonal variability in the Nepali setting .
Questions were answered by the head of the household ( generally a male in this setting ) and asked about insufficient quantity and quality of foods and anxiety and uncertainty about food supply .
Compared to other measures , this set of questions does not address either individual household members access or more distal factors such as livelihood production [32] .
We use a validated scoring algorithm , to create a four - group categorical variable ranging from “ food secure ” ( 1 ) to “ severe food insecurity ” , as is categorized by the Nepal DHS ( 4 ) .
For the interaction model , we created a binary variable , collapsing none / mild / moderate vs . severe food insecurity .
The primary outcome of interest is a binary for current use of a modern family planning method compared to no method or a non - modern method .
We use multivariate logistic regressions to assess for associations between food insecurity , women ’ s household status , and modern family planning use .
We control for socio - demographic factors found in past literature to be associated with women ’ s household status , food insecurity and / or family planning use in this setting .
At the household level , these include wealth quintile ( calculated by the DHS Program , provided in the dataset ) , urban / rural status , geographic region ( mountains , hills or Terai ) , caste / ethnicity ( Brahmin / Chhetri , Newar , Dalit , Janajati , other ) , and religion ( Hindu compared to any other religious group ) .
At the individual level we control for women ’ s age ( in 10 year age groups ) , education ( none , primary , secondary , and higher than secondary , as categorized by the DHS Nepal ) , type of occupation ( professional occupation vs . not ) , if she is the head of the household ( yes / no ) , and the total number of living children that the woman has ( continuous ) .
Furthermore , we include a variable of the ratio of the number of boys divided by the number of girls that a woman has at the time of the survey , to account for the effect of having a son on a woman ’ s position in the household and probability of using modern family planning .
We also include a score of women ’ s decision making level in the household .
This is comprised of six binary questions about who ( the woman alone , woman and her husband , husband alone , other ) makes decisions about the following : what to do with money that the husband earns , what to do with the money the respondent earns , using family planning , the respondents health care , large purchases , and visits to family / relatives .
These were then summed to create the final score ( ranging from 0 - 6 ) .
Since more than one woman could live in each household and the main predictor is a household level variable , each woman received a weight based on the number of women in the sample in her household ( 0.5 if there were two women , 0.33 if there were 3 women , etc . ) .
This weight is multiplied by the survey weight provided by ICF Macro .
Data were analyzed using STATA 12 .
Study design and data sources : This population - based cancer - registry study was conducted in the BCR .
The BCR routinely collects information regarding new cancer diagnoses in Belgium including patient characteristics ( such as age at diagnosis , region of residence ) and tumour characteristics ( such as date of diagnosis , cancer topography and morphology ) on a national level since the incidence year 2004 .
In Belgium , the specific Health Law of December 13th 2006 [18] has made cancer registration compulsory for the pathological anatomy laboratories and for the oncological care programs .
Moreover , the reimbursement of multidisciplinary oncological consultation for each reported case of cancer acts as an incentive for the cancer registration .
This provides high quality data and high completeness of BCR database , which is estimated to be more than 95 % complete using cross - validation techniques [19] .
The remaining incompleteness is most likely due to elderly patients with a very poor prognosis at diagnosis and outpatients with a clinical diagnosis only .
Based on the aforementioned law , the BCR has also the legal authorization to use the National Social Security Number ( NSSN ) as a unique patient identifier .
This NSSN allows the BCR to deterministically link its data with data from the Crossroads Bank for Social Security ( CBSS ) to retrieve information on vital status .
The NSSN can also be used to deterministically link the BCR data with reimbursement data from the health insurance companies , provided by the Intermutualistic Agency ( IMA ) .
As health insurance is mandatory in Belgium , administrative , medical claims data from IMA are available for almost the entire Belgian population .
The IMA database contains information regarding all reimbursed medications and medical acts .
Since statins are reimbursed drugs that are only available on prescription in Belgium , all dispensed statin prescriptions can be identified within IMA data .
In addition , for more than 90 % of the BCR population [19] , death certificates provided by the regional administrations can be used to retrieve causes of death using a linkage based on several variables ( such as date of birth , date of death , sex , residence at time of death ) .
The linkage of the BCR - , the IMA - , the CBSS - and the regional administrations ’ databases thus provides information on all patients diagnosed with cancers in Belgium , on their vital status , their date and cause of death , the cancer treatments they received , and their medication use .
Specific ethical approvals were not required because the analyses were conducted within the legal framework of the BCR , using only anonymized data and without any access to private information on individual patients .
All patients with an OC ( ICD - 10 code C56 ) diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 were identified from the BCR .
Patients with borderline malignant tumours or with non - epithelial cancers were excluded .
Patients with another invasive cancer diagnosis ( apart from non - melanoma skin cancer ) prior to their OC diagnosis were also excluded .
Additionally , patients who died within six months after OC diagnosis were excluded as these patients were mainly diagnosed in advance stage disease .
It seems unlikely that short term postdiagnostic medication usage could influence their survival .
Therefore , the beginning of the follow - up time was set to 6 months after diagnosis .
The other exclusion criteria were related to missing data or absence of follow - up data , thus , patients were also excluded if they did not have an available NSSN or available IMA data , if they died on the day of diagnosis or if they were lost to follow - up at diagnosis .
Exclusions based on these criteria are expected to be rare in our study population because in the general BCR database , only 1.5 % and 3.4 % of patients don ’ t have a NSSN or IMA data available , only 0.16 % of patients died on the day of diagnosis and 1.2 % of patients are lost to follow - up at diagnosis [20] .
Patients were followed from six months after diagnosis to a maximum of 3 years after their OC diagnosis ( or to the end of follow - up on July 1st , 2015 ) .
Use of statins was identified from IMA data using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) codes ‘ C10A A ’ .
To avoid immortal time bias [21] , statin use was modelled as a time varying covariate , i.e. patients were initially considered as nonusers and then became users after their first statin prescription .
As recommended in studies of medication use and cancer survival [22] , a lag period of 6 months was applied to exclude prescriptions that fall within the 6 months period prior to death because these may be affected by palliative treatments .
Statins were also examined by each statin type and by subgroups of statins according to solubility type , i.e. lipophilic agents ( simvastatin and fluvastatin ) and hydrophilic agents ( atorvastatin , pravastatin and rosuvastatin ) .
Statin exposure was further investigated in a dose - response analysis by counting the total daily defined doses ( DDD ) of statins that the patient received during the follow - up .
After their first statin prescription , patients were considered as light users and they became heavy users as soon as they cumulated at least 365 / 2 DDDs .
The available covariates were age at diagnosis , year of cancer diagnosis , histological grade , combined stage ( according to the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours , 7th edition ) , cancer histologic subtype , and cancer treatments ( including surgery , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy in the 9 months after diagnosis ) .
Cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes were estimated using a previously described methodology based on specific drugs prescriptions in the year before the diagnosis [23] .
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients at the time of diagnosis .
These analyses were conducted within subgroups of statin users and nonusers in order to compare characteristics in these two groups .
Patient - and tumor characteristics in each group are reported as frequencies and percentages .
Age was the only variable considered both in categories and as a continuous variable .
Time - dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios ( HRs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) for postdiagnostic statin users compared to nonusers and risk of overall mortality within 3 years after diagnosis .
Analyses were adjusted for the following potential confounders : age in categories ( ≤ 49 years , 50 - 74 years , ≥ 75 years ) , year of diagnosis ( in 3 - year bands : 2004 to 2006 , 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to 2012 ) , cancer stage ( I , II , III , IV ) , cancer treatments ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy , adjuvant chemotherapy , chemotherapy only , surgery only and no treatment ) , cardiovascular comorbidities ( yes or no ) and diabetes ( yes or no ) .
Subgroup analyses were conducted by age categories , year of diagnosis , cancer stage , histologic subtype , cancer treatment and prediagnostic statin use .
Tests for interactions were performed using interaction terms within Cox regression models .
A sensitivity analysis that controls for immortal time bias without requiring time varying covariate was conducted .
This simplified analysis used Cox regression to compare statin users to statin nonusers in the first 6 months after diagnosis .
After the exclusion of deceased patients having missing death certificates ( n = 521 , 10 % ) , analyses were also performed for ovarian cancer specific - mortality ( S1 and S2 Tables and S1 Fig ) .
The statistical significance level was set to P < 0.05 .
All analyses were performed using the statistical software SAS Enterprise Guide 5.1 .
We conducted a retrospective analysis of the TARN database , a clinical registry that collects data from all “ trauma - receiving ” hospitals in England for patients with traumatic injuries .
The best practice tariff for major trauma centres promotes timely entry of clinical data to TARN [16] .
TARN has PIAG Section 60 approval for research using the data that it holds .
We split the analysis into minor and major trauma ( ISS of less than and greater than 15 respectively ) .
The trauma network system in England is predominantly focused on the most severely injured patients by concentrating resources in Major Trauma Centres and caring for the highest acuity patients at these hospitals [17] .
Therefore , minor and major trauma patients are treated using distinct clinical pathways , and are analysed as such .
We used national data from NHS hospitals ( universally free healthcare ) in England from the Trauma Audit and Research Network ( TARN ) to examine this potential effect .
We included all individuals who were admitted to “ trauma - receiving ” hospitals secondary to trauma and treated as an in - patient for 3 or more days , admitted to critical care units or died in hospital .
Isolated closed limb fractures and neck of femur fractures in patients over 65 are excluded from TARN .
Data collection period : 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2015 and limited to patient ’ s resident in England .
Data include patient age and sex , postcode sector , mode of injury , injury severity score ( ISS ) , comorbidity and mortality at 30 , 90 and 180 days .
The primary outcome was 30 - day mortality .
Thirty - day mortality is determined by referencing hospital records for in - patients and via linkage to Office for National Statistics data for those who have been discharged .
We selected 30 - day mortality as the primary outcome variable as primary mortality diagnoses at 90 and 180 days are increasingly less likely to be caused by the index trauma episode .
The primary predictor variable was SES based on deprivation of area of residence .
This study assigned a standardised measure of deprivation to each record in TARN , using the English indices of deprivation 2015 , Index of Multiple Deprivation ( IMD ) [18] .
The indices are derived from census and local administrative data and used to construct seven domains of deprivation : income , employment , health and disability , education skill and training , barriers to housing and other services , crime , and living environment .
The IMD is a weighted score of the seven domains , and a robust and commonly used measure of deprivation in England .
The IMD is available at Lower Super Output Area ( LSOA ) level , a small geographical boundary containing approximately 1500 persons .
Within TARN each record has a geographical indicator , the postcode - sector .
To assign the Indices of Deprivation to each record we calculated a synthetic domain score and IMD score for each postcode sector in England by weighting LSOA level deprivation scores based on the geographical contribution of each LSOA to each postcode sector [18] .
The resulting synthetic scores were then grouped into country specific national quintiles of deprivation for the IMD , where quintile 1 is the most deprived and quintile 5 the least deprived [19] .
This is an established method of IMD estimation that has been used previously [20] .
Covariates included age group , sex , ISS category and comorbidity .
Age was grouped into 0 to 15 years old , 16 to 24 , 25 to 39 , 40 to 64 , 65 to 84 , and 85 and older .
ISS was split into four categories , two in major trauma ( ISS 16 to 24 and greater than 24 ) , and two in minor trauma ( ISS less than 9 and 9 to 15 ) .
These are established cut - offs [21,22] , and their usefulness derives from patients with isolated injuries of increasing severity appearing in different groups .
Comorbidity is calculated by TARN using the pre - existing medical conditions ( PMC ) score , modified from the Charlson Comorbidity Index .
Each comorbid condition is assigned a weight , based on the impact of the condition on outcome , with higher values assigned to more severe conditions .
Weights are then summed for each case [23,24] .
The scores were categorised as 0 , 1 to 5 , 6 to 10 and greater than 10 as per TARN criteria .
Data were analysed using Stata V 13 ( StataCorp , Stata Statistical Software : Release 13 , College Station , Texas , USA ) .
All analyses were run separately for both minor and major trauma .
Absolute 30 - day mortality , and proportion , were determined for each age group , sex , ISS categorisation , comorbidity group and IMD quintile .
Cross - tables of IMD quintile by other variables with Chi squared tests are included in the supporting information ( S1 Table ) .
Univariate logistic regression models with 30 - day mortality as the outcome measure were ran for age group , sex , ISS categorisation , comorbidity and IMD quintile .
A multivariable logistic regression model was run with 30 - day mortality as the outcome measure and all variables included in univariate regression input .
Model fitting was based on variables identified as part of a priori statistical plan and used a categorical variable for socioeconomic deprivation ( reference group : quintile 5 ) , sex ( reference group : female ) , age group ( reference group : 0 - 15 years ) , and ISS category ( reference group for minor : ISS < 9 ; reference group for major : ISS 16 - 24 ) .
Additional multivariate regression models with deprivation included as a continuous variable ( IMD score ) are included in the supporting information ( S2 Table ) .
Sensitivity analyses were run using 90 - day and 180 - day mortality as the outcome variable for the multivariate logistic regression models .
The results for the sensitivity analyses are included in the supplementary appendix ( S3 and S4 Tables ) .
All patients who had undergone LC performed between May , 2007 and June , 2009 by any surgeons practicing at two tertiary academic hospitals in southern Taiwan were surveyed by the SF - 36 and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life ( GIQLI ) instruments .
Ethical approval was provided by Institutional Review Board of the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital ( KMUH - IRB - 960169 ) .
Patients provided written informed consent .
Patients with cognitive impairment ( n = 1 ) , severe organ disease ( n = 4 ) or psychiatric disease ( n = 1 ) were excluded .
Of the 518 eligible subjects who gave written consent and were enrolled in the study at baseline , twelve were excluded due to conversion of LC to open cholecystectomy ( OC ) , and 106 were excluded because they did not undergo postoperative assessments .
All 400 of the remaining LC subjects completed the preoperative and 2 - year postoperative assessments .
The SF - 36 ( Chinese version ) was administered to measure QOL outcomes , and the score was used as a dependent variable .
As described in the literature , the physical component summary scale ( PCS ) and mental component summary scale ( MCS ) were calculated using norm - based scoring methods to compare QOL in the study population with that of the general Taiwan population [19] .
A PCS or MCS value of 50 was considered average for the general Taiwan population .
Both PCS and MCS have been widely adopted and were used in the present study to provide an overall QOL index and for further study of longitudinal changes in generic measures as a whole [20] .
The GIQLI is recognized as a valid and reliable instrument for measuring functional status , especially in patients undergoing cholecystectomy [13] .
Each of its thirty - six items is scored from 0 to 4 with a higher score indicating better health status , and the total GIQLI score ranges from 0 to 144 .
A Chinese version of the GIQLI has demonstrated validity [2] , [13] .
The following patient data obtained by records review and questionnaire interview were tested as independent variables in this study : age , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , education , Charlson co - morbidity index ( CCI ) score , marital status , previous abdominal surgery , surgical factors , patient referral source , current alcohol or tobacco use , preoperative functional status , operating time , American Society of Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) score , current complications , operation time , length of stay ( LOS ) and re - hospitalization within 30 days .
The factors used in the MLR model to predict long - term QOL of LC patients included both demographic and clinical characteristics .
The MLR model can be formulated as the following linear equation : where is the actual output value , is the intercept , is the model coefficient parameter , is the independent or input variable , is the random error , and m is the number of variables .
The SVM model employs non - linear mapping to transform the original training data into higher - dimensional data and searches for the linear optima that define a hyperplane within the new dimension [4] .
With appropriate non - linear mapping to a sufficiently high dimension , a decision boundary can separate data into two classes [4] .
In the SVM model , this decision boundary is defined by support vectors and margins .
The GPR applies a Bayesian approach to nonlinear regression .
The Bayesian paradigm provides probabilistic modeling of nonlinear regression .
The Bayesian approach to regression specifies a priori probabilities of the parameters to be estimated , and it computes the maximum a posteriori probabilities given the observed data samples .
Unlike non - Bayesian schemes , which typically choose a single parameter based on a specified criterion , the Bayesian probabilistic model obtains both the optimal estimated function and the covariance associated with the estimation .
Therefore , the Bayesian paradigm provides more information about the estimated parameters compared to non - Bayesian methodology .
The GPR is a memory - based method of storing some or all of the training data for use in testing .
Therefore , GPR can be quickly trained , which improves the efficiency of the massive - training methodology [7] .
The ANN model used in this study was a standard feed - forward , back - propagation neural network with three layers : an input layer , a hidden layer and an output layer .
The multilayer perceptron ( MLP ) network is an emerging tool for designing special classes of layered feed - forward networks [21] .
Its input layer consists of source nodes , and its output layer consists of neurons ; these layers connect the network to the outside world .
In addition to these two layers , the MLP usually has one or more layers of neurons referred to as hidden neurons because they are not directly accessible .
The hidden neurons extract important features contained in the input data .
The dataset was divided randomly into two sets , one set of 320 cases ( 80 % of the overall dataset ) for training the model and another set of eighty cases for testing the model .
The model was built using the training set .
Demographic and clinical characteristics were the independent variables , and the outcome ( QOL ) was the dependent variable .
The SVM , GPR , MLR and ANN models were then tested using the eighty cases in the testing dataset .
The model fit and prediction accuracy of the system models were measured in terms of mean square error ( MSE ) and mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ) , respectively .
The MSE , which is computed between the desired and predicted values and then averaged across all data , is used as an indicator of goodness of fit .
The MAPE indicates the average deviation from the desired value and is usually expressed as a percentage [22] .
The prediction accuracy of a model is considered excellent if its MAPE value is lower than 10 % .
Values between 10 % and 20 % , between 20 % and 50 % , and higher than 50 % are considered indicators of high , average , and low prediction accuracy , respectively [22] .
The formulas for calculating MSE and MAPE are andwhere n is the number of observations , is the desired ( target ) value of the ith observation , and is the actual output value of the ith observation .
The change rates are also given .
The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the activation functions are iteratively determined by comparing the MSE index of the output error among several neural networks .
The network training process continues as long as training and test errors decrease .
That is , training stops when the training error rate and test error rate no longer change or when they begin increasing .
The prediction accuracy of the model is then judged by computing the MAPE value .
The change rate is also used to compare model performance between the training and test sets .
This criterion is used to calculate the difference in MSE index between the test and the training sets so that the better model can be identified .
Absolute value was defined as [ ( the MSE value from test set - the MSE value from training set ) / ( the MSE value from training set ) ] × 100 % .
The lower the change rate and the lower the MSE value are , the better the model performs .
The unit of analysis in this study was the individual LC surgery patient .
The data analysis was performed in several stages .
Firstly , continuous variables were tested for statistical significance by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , and categorical variables were tested by Fisher exact analysis .
Univariate analyses were applied to identify significant predictors ( P < 0.05 ) .
Secondly , STATISTICA 10.0 ( StatSoft , Tulsa , OK ) software was used to construct the MLP network model , the SVM model , the GPR model and the MLR model of the relationship between the identified predictors and QOL .
Finally , sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the importance of variables in the fitted models .
To simplify the training process , key variables were introduced , and unnecessary variables were excluded .
A global sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the relative significance of input parameters in the system model and to rank the variables in order of importance .
The global sensitivity of the input variables against the output variable was expressed as the ratio of the network error ( variable sensitivity ratios , VSR ) with a given input omitted to the network error with the input included .
A ratio of 1 or lower indicates that the variable degrades network performance and should be removed .
Study design and data collection : The Indian Migration Study ( IMS ) was set up to examine the effects of rural to urban migration on obesity and diabetes .
The study was nested in a larger sentinel surveillance study of cardiovascular risk factors in industrial settings [33] , and used a sibling - pair comparison design in which urban factory workers who had migrated from rural areas were recruited together with their rural - dwelling sibling who had not migrated .
Details of the design and major findings have been reported elsewhere [14] .
Briefly , the study was based in factories in four Indian cities ( Lucknow - Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd ; Nagpur - Indorama Synthetics Ltd , Hyderabad - Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and Bangalore - Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd ) situated in the north , centre and south of the country .
Factory workers and their co - resident spouses were recruited if they were rural - urban migrants , using employer records as the sampling frame .
Each participant was asked to invite one non - migrant full sibling of the same sex and closest to them in age still residing in their rural place of origin .
A 25 % random sample of urban non - migrant factory workers and spouses was invited to participate in the study , and also asked to invite a sib who resided in the same city but did not work in the factory .
Information sheets were translated into local languages and explained to participants by trained interviewers and signed ( or thumb print used if illiterate ) to indicate informed consent .
Ethics committee approval was obtained from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee .
Field work began in March 2005 and was completed by December 2007 .
Diet was assessed by an interviewer - administered semi - quantitative food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) .
The questionnaire assessed portion size and frequency of intake of 184 commonly consumed food items , asking about consumption over the last year .
A standard portion size was assigned to each food ( e.g. tablespoon , ladel , bowl ) , and participants were shown examples of these vessels and asked to report portions consumed as multiples of this .
Frequency was recorded as daily , weekly , monthly , yearly / never .
A single FFQ was used to cover the four regions of the study .
Nutrient databases were developed for the study by collecting recipes from participants in rural and urban areas of each region , and using Indian food composition tables to calculate nutrient content of each recipe [34] .
Where nutrient values were unavailable from the Indian food composition tables ( e.g. for foods such as manufactured ‘ western ’ snacks and sweetened drinks ) , the United States Department of Agriculture nutrient database ( USDA , Release No . 14 ) [35] or McCance and Widdowsons Composition of Foods were used [36] .
Because of variation in food preparation , region , rural / urban , and cooking oil specific databases were used for calculation of average daily dietary intake .
Energy , carbohydrate , fat , saturated fat , protein , as well as proportion of energy from carbohydrate , fat and protein , and energy density , were considered .
The recipes were also used to generate databases of the food group composition of each food item , and used to calculate average daily food group intake .
For this analysis the following food groups were considered : fruit ; vegetables ( including vegetables added to preparations , and salads ) ; legumes ( pulses , lentils , whole gram preparations ) ; sugar ( sugar and jaggery used in preparations and added to beverages ) ; meat ( including meat added to mixed dishes ) ; fish ; and dairy ( including dairy products added to beverages and preparations ) .
To measure socio - economic position , a subset of 14 of 29 questions were used from the Standard of Living Index ( SLI ) , a household level asset based scale devised for Indian surveys [37] , selecting those believed to be most informative for the study population , and weighting them to give a maximum score of 38 .
Weights of items for the SLI developed by the International Institute of Population Sciences in India , and based on a priori knowledge about the relative significance of the items , were used in these analyses .
Analyses of IMS data to date have shown large differences in chronic disease profile .
For example , BMI in rural , migrant and urban men was 21.9 , 24.0 and 24.3 respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) and in women 22.5 , 25.2 , and 25.9 respectively ( p < 0.0001 ) [14] .
Initial analyses of the dietary data also showed that consumption was mainly of traditional foods in rural , migrant , and urban groups , and that there were low levels of western foods consumption [38] .
Rural - urban migrants , their rural siblings , and urban non - migrants and their urban siblings were included in analyses .
Distributions of macronutrient intake were checked for outliers .
Median values and lower and upper quartiles were calculated ( because of the skewed distribution of some variables ) for energy intake , macronutrient intake ( protein , fat , saturated fat , and carbohydrate , and percent energy from each of these ) , and energy - density , by sex and migration status .
Nutrients were transformed to the natural log scale and statistical tests for the significance of the trend in mean values across rural , migrant , and urban groups were calculated using linear regression models and Wald test statistics , adjusted for age and factory site .
Analyses were carried out separately in men and women , as we anticipated that there may be gender differences in the effect of migration , and also because of the statistical dependency between husbands and wives produced by the study design .
Robust standard errors were used to account for clustering in sibling pairs .
Similar analyses were conducted to examine variation in food groups by migration status .
Vegetarianism was assessed by whether the participant reported consumption of any meat or fish in the FFQ .
Differences in the proportion of vegetarians in rural , migrant and urban groups were assessed via Wald test statistics from a logistic regression model , adjusting for age , factory , and again accounting for clustering in sibling pairs by calculating robust standard errors .
For meat and fish , differences in intake were considered for participants who were non - vegetarians only .
Further analyses examining differences ( suitably transformed ) in intake between migrant and non - migrant siblings , taking advantage of the sibling - pair design , were also conducted as this comparison provides a high level of control for known and unknown genetic and early life confounders .
Only rural - urban migrant pairs were included in these analyses as urban non - migrant sib - pairs were not informative for assessing migration effects .
Because not all siblings were matched on sex , sex - specific z - scores of intake were calculated using the rural distribution as reference .
Within pair differences in z - scores for energy , macronutrients , energy density , and food groups were considered and modelled using linear regression .
Although the sibling closest in age was recruited , differences in age were inevitable so the within - pair difference in age was considered as a potential confounder .
Factory was not controlled for because it did not vary within pairs .
The estimated intercept in these models is to be interpreted as the estimated mean difference in z - scores between same - age siblings and therefore as the age - adjusted effect of migration .
Mean differences and 95 % confidence intervals were graphed to aid interpretation .
Differences in energy - adjusted intake were calculated using the residuals method [39] , calculating z - scores of residuals in each sibling , and taking the difference of these scores .
The additional effect of the amount of time the migrant sibling had spent in urban areas ( with categories : < 10 years or 10 + years ) was also studied by extending each of the linear regression models used to study the macronutrients and the food groups , with significance assessed via Wald tests .
Similarly , effect differences by factory were studied by including factory indicators in the models .
All analyses were conducted using STATA 11 statistical software ( StataCorp . 2009 . Stata Statistical Software : Release 11 . College Station , TX : StataCorp LP ) .
Patients , controls and clinical assessment : Our pilot study involved measuring MIF - concentrations in the diagnostically obtained CSF from 20 patients with optic neuritis ( ON ) as first inflammatory episode in clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS , n = 9 ) or relapsing - remitting MS ( RRMS , n = 11 ) , according to the McDonald criteria ( 2010 ) [25] .
The second group of CSF - MIF measurements were from 18 patients who had been diagnosed with CIS ( n = 9 ) / MS ( n = 9 ) but had not presented with an acute clinical relapse within the preceding 4 weeks or received any steroids within the 8 weeks ( CIS / MS without acute relapse = CIS / MS w / o ) prior to study inclusion ( mean [ SD ] latency between last relapse and lumbar puncture = 31 [39] months ) .
CSF was additionally acquired from a hospital - based cohort of n = 20 healthy controls ( HC ) .
In these healthy individuals the presence of a neurological disorder had been suspected , but was not confirmed .
In addition to the clinical classification , patients included in the control group also fulfilled the following Reiber laboratory criteria defining a non - inflammatory CSF ( < 5 cells / μ l , > 500 mg protein / ml , < 2 mmol / l lactate , no disruption of the blood / CSF barrier , no oligoclonal bands ( OCB ) in the CSF , and no intrathecal immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G , IgA , or IgM synthesis ) [26] .
Patients of all three groups were clinically evaluated in accordance with German guidelines ( including the Expanded disability status scale [ EDSS ] [27] ) .
Disease duration was defined as the time in months between symptom onset and lumbar puncture ( LP ) .
No patient had received any disease - modifying treatment before LP .
In the ON group , visual acuity was measured preceding GC - treatment , on the last day of GC administration , as well as after therapy escalation including plasma exchange .
To verify ON - induced axonal disintegration , visual evoked potentials ( VEP ) were recorded before GC - treatment in at least two trials for each eye , averaging > 150 responses , with electrodes positioned at Oz ( active ) and Fz , in accordance with the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision ( ISCEV ) standards [28] .
Latencies of the P100 exceeding a 2.5 standard deviation ( SD ) from normative data were considered as abnormal VEPs .
P100 peak - latencies were measured to reflect the degree of demyelination .
VEPs with no stimulation response were excluded ( n = 6 / 20 ) .
Brain MRI scans from patients originated from non - standardized protocols from differing MRI units and magnetic field strengths ( 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla ) conducted close to the LP .
All examinations included T1 - and T2 - weighted spin - echo sequences with the administration of gadolinium ( Gd ) .
Abnormalities including T1 - hypointesities , T2 - hyperintesities and Gd - enhanced T1 - lesions were initially identified by a neuroradiologist and they were subsequently verified by a MS specialist ( M.P . ) .
Irrespective of the degree of relapse - induced visual loss , ON patients were treated for at least 5 days with a high daily dose ( 1 g ) of intravenous methylprednisolone .
For this group , GC - responsive ON ( GC - ON ) was defined as visual improvement after 5 days of treatment , with a visual acuity correction of > 10 % compared to baseline , whereas GC - refractory ON ( rGC - ON ) was defined by a 0 - 10 % change in visual acuity .
All patients were recruited retrospectively in the Department of Neurology , Otto - von - Guericke University , Magdeburg , Germany , between 2012 and May 2017 .
Thus , no written informant consent could be obtained , but all parameters were taken from routine clinical diagnostics .
The data were anonymized , precluding identification of individual patients .
The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at the University Hospital Magdeburg and Otto - von - Guericke University Magdeburg ( No . 07 / 17 ) .
Immediately after LP , CSF cell concentration was determined , and total protein , albumin quotient ( Qalb ) , and OCB were measured .
The remaining CSF material was centrifuged at 4 ° C , aliquoted , and stored at - 80 ° C until CSF - MIF analysis took place .
The absolute CSF - MIF concentrations were measured using commercially available human MIF Quantikine ELISA ( bio - techne , Mineapolis , MN ) , following the instructions provided by the manufacturer .
All samples were run in duplicate , and the mean was used for statistical analysis .
Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 21 ( IBM ) .
A one - way - ANOVA was conducted with group ( HC vs . CIS / MS w / o vs . ON cases ) as the independent variable , followed by pairwise post - hoc testing ( Bonferroni - corrected ) .
The groups were also compared with respect to categorical variables ( using a chi - squared test ) and continuous variables ( using a t - test or Mann - Whitney U test ) , to determine group differences between GC - ON and rGC - ON cases , taking into account age , median visual acuity before and after GC administration , P100 latency , CSF cell count , Qalb , and CSF - MIF .
A Wilcoxon test was used to determine whether visual improvement occurred after plasma exchange in the rGC - ON group .
Spearman ’ s rank correlations were performed between CSF - MIF and age , further CSF measures ( cell count , Qalb , relative monocyte fraction ) , disease duration , T2 - lesion count and P100 latency .
P - values ≤ 0.05 were deemed to be statistically significant .
The State Scientific Center of the Russian Federation - IBMP of the Russian Academy of Sciences performed the Mars 500 project at the IBMP in Moscow , which consisted of three isolation studies with six crewmembers each : a 14 - day pilot study ( completed in November 2007 ) , a 105 - day pilot study ( completed in July 2009 ) , and the main 520 - day study simulating a mission to Mars ( completed in November 2011 ) , which is the focus of this manuscript .
The high fidelity of the simulation to actual spaceflight was reflected in the following features of the experiment : ( i ) a multinational crew of N = 6 healthy adult male volunteers selected by the Russian Federation ( N = 3 ) , the European Space Agency ( N = 2 ) , and the China National Space Administration ( N = 1 ) , who were trained together and who were similar in age ( average age at hatch closing 32 years , range 27 - 38 ) , careers , and education ( e.g. , engineers , physicians , military backgrounds ) to astronauts / cosmonauts living on the ISS ; ( ii ) 520 consecutive days of confinement ( 3 June 2010 to 4 November 2011 ) in a 550 m3 pressurized facility with a volume and configuration comparable to a spacecraft with interconnected habitable modules ; ( iii ) facility modules equipped with life support systems and an artificial atmospheric environment at normal barometric pressure ; ( iv ) activities that simulated aspects of the International Space Station with daily maintenance work , scientific experiments , and exercise ; ( v ) isolation from Earth ' s daily environmental light - dark cycles , temperatures and seasonal conditions ; ( vi ) a realistic Mars flight simulation based in orbital mechanics and under the direction of mission controllers , with a 30 - day Mars orbiting phase ( between mission days 244 and 273 ) and 3 of the 6 crewmembers simulating egresses on the Martian surface ( between mission days 257 and 265 ) ; ( vii ) work throughout the 520 - day mission that included both routine and simulated emergency events ; ( viii ) changes in communication modes and time delays between mission days 54 and 470 that would occur in transit to and from Mars ; ( ix ) limited consumable resources ( food and water ) ; and ( x ) the crew awareness of frequent publicity of the mission by media and the public .
Thus , Mars 520 had many essential features of an isolated and confined environment ( ICE ) that had the fidelity necessary to study behavioral and psychological reactions to prolonged space flight .
The crew lived on a 5 - day work cycle , with two days off , except for simulation of special situations ( e.g. , emergencies ) .
For the whole mission operations were organized around 24 - h clock time .
A typical workday would start with personal hygiene and breakfast at 8 : 00 followed by operative work ( including facility inspection ) , operative meetings , and the preparation of scientific experiments .
After lunch ( served between 13 : 30 and 14 : 30 ) , the crews performed the scientific experiments and exercised until supper was served at ca . 19 : 30 .
The rest of the evening could be used for personal time .
A total of 91 experiments in the areas of physiology ( N = 20 ) , psychology ( N = 21 ) , biochemistry , immunology , and biology ( N = 34 ) , microbiology ( N = 8 ) , and operations and technology ( N = 8 ) were performed during the 520 days of the mission .
Not all of the experiments required the crew ' s active participation .
Sampling frequency differed between experiments and ranged from three times during the mission to continuously throughout the mission , with most of the studies sampling data on a regular but discontinuous basis ( e.g. , once every month ) .
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , USA .
Prior to the start of the study , all subjects signed written informed consent forms .
They were compensated for their participation in the study , and they were free to discontinue the study at any time .
The crewmembers revealed their identities before , during and after the simulation .
To ensure confidentiality in this manuscript , results were de - identified ( i.e. , crewmembers were randomly assigned English alphabetic letters a - f ) and no data were reported relative to crewmembers ' nationalities , ages , professions , or roles in the mission .
2.2 Experimental procedures and measurements : All instructions and subjective rating scales were translated and displayed in Russian for the three Russian participants , and in English for the non - Russian participants .
2.2.1.1 Social Desirability Scale 17 ( SDS - 17 ) : Once during the two weeks prior to hatch closing , each crewmember filled out the Social Desirability Scale 17 ( SDS - 17 ) , which measured social desirability bias [8] .
The latter is defined as “ distorting one ' s self - presentation to make a favorable impression upon others . ”
Social desirability may represent , among others , internalization of cultural values , the expression of ongoing personality traits , or an overly favorable self - evaluation [9] .
The SDS - 17 is composed of 16 true - false items ( one item was dropped from the final scale ) , six of them reverse keyed .
A score of 16 represents maximal distortion of one ' s self representation to make a favorable impression .
2.2.1.2 Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) : Immediately prior to and / or following each PVT - B test bout , crewmembers filled out several computerized questionnaires and rating scales .
Crewmembers indicated their current status on 100 mm visual analogue scales ( VAS ) with the following binary anchors : happy - unhappy ; healthy - sick ; energetic - physically exhausted ; mentally sharp - mentally fatigued ; not stressed - very stressed ; fresh / ready to go - tired ; good sleep quality - poor sleep quality ( morning only ) ; and high workload - low workload ( evening only ) .
2.2.1.3 Profile of Mood States - Short Form ( POMS - SF ) : Crewmembers completed the POMS - SF [10] , [11] in the morning once each week .
POMS - SF is a measure of psychological distress in a variety of healthy , physically ill , and psychiatric populations .
It consists of a list of 37 adjectives .
Crewmembers had to indicate the degree to which each adjective described themselves at the moment they took the test using a 5 - point Likert format .
Standard scoring of the POMS yields a global distress score referred to as Total Mood Disturbance as well as scores for six subscales : Fatigue - Inertia , Vigor - Activity , Tension - Anxiety , Depression - Dejection , Anger - Hostility , and Confusion - Bewilderment .
2.2.1.4 Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI - II ) : Once a week in the evening , crewmembers completed the modified Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI - II ) [12] , a 21 - question multiple - choice self - report inventory for measuring the severity of depression .
The BDI - II was scored by summing the highest ratings for each item .
Each item is rated on a 4 - point scale ranging from 0 to 3 , and the total scores can range from 0 to 63 .
The BDI - II can be separated in an 8 - item affective subscale ( pessimism , past failures , guilt feelings , punishment feelings , self - dislike , self - criticalness , suicidal thoughts or wishes , and worthlessness ) and a 13 - item somatic subscale ( sadness , loss of pleasure , crying , agitation , loss of interest , indecisiveness , loss of energy , change in sleep patterns , irritability , change in appetite , concentration difficulties , tiredness and / or fatigue , and loss of interest in sex ) .
Crewmembers were asked to indicate how they felt during the past week .
The question on suicidal thoughts was removed from the BDI - II for reasons of cultural sensitivity , reducing the number of items to 20 and the maximum score from 63 to 60 . 2.2.1.5 Conflict Questionnaire ( CQ ) : Weekly , in the evening , crewmembers filled out a brief conflict questionnaire developed for the study .
They were asked to indicate , both currently and in the last 7 days , whether they had a conflict with either another crewmember or mission controllers .
If they indicated a conflict had occurred , they were to indicate whether or not it was resolved .
They did not have to indicate the identity of the person ( s ) with whom they indicated they had a conflict .
Data acquisition for psychological measures resulted in 100 % completed tests ( i.e. , N = 6 for SDS - 17 ; N = 444 for BDI - II ; POMS - SF ; CQ ; VAS for workload and sleep quality ratings ; and N = 888 for VAS scales for unhappiness , physical exhaustion , mental fatigue , stress , tiredness ) .
2.2.1.6 Post - mission debrief interviews : During individual crewmember ' s debrief interviews the second day post - mission confinement , crewmembers were asked to name the two crewmembers with whom they communicated most frequently .
2.2.2.1 Actigraphy : Actigraphy is a reliable , non - invasive method to validly assess rest - activity cycles [13] .
Throughout the 520 - day simulated mission to Mars , each crewmember continuously wore a wristwatch size actigraph ( Actiwatch Spectrum , Philips / Respironics ) on the wrist of the non - dominant arm .
The device measured both average white light intensity ( illuminance in Lux ) and a calibrated activity level from movement - induced accelerations of the wrist .
It also displayed clock time .
In the Mars 520 - day study actigraphs recorded one activity and one illuminance value per minute .
A validated algorithm [14] was used to automatically classify 1 - min actigraphy epochs into active wake , sleep , or waking rest ( Respironics Actiware , Version 5.59.0015 , standard settings ) .
In cases of obvious misclassification , the automatic scoring was corrected manually ( less than 2.8 % of the automatic scoring was corrected this way ) .
Epochs with off - wrist or missing data ( due to data downloads or equipment failure ) were classified accordingly .
Overall , 4,396,333 min ( 73,272 h or 98.0 % ) of valid actigraphy data were obtained from the 6 crewmembers while they lived in the facility throughout the Mars 520 - day study .
For statistical analyses off - wrist or missing actigraphy epochs were imputed with averages of non - missing epochs calculated for each crewmember , each mission quarter , and each of the 1440 min of the day .
2.2.2.2 Psychomotor Vigilance Test ( PVT - B ) : Once per week , each crewmember performed a 3 - minute version of the Psychomotor Vigilance Test on a calibrated laptop computer ( Pulsar Informatics , Inc . ) to assess the effects of potential changes in sleep - wake behavior .
The PVT - B measures vigilant attention by recording response time ( RT ) to visual stimuli that occur at random inter - stimulus intervals ( ISI ) , and it has negligible aptitude and learning effects [15] , [16] .
The brief PVT ( i.e. , PVT - B ) was validated against the standard 10 - minute PVT [17] and shown to predict performance on a simulated luggage screening task [18] .
Each crewmember performed the PVT - B on a different day of the week , once in the morning after waking up and once in the evening .
The test required visually monitoring a red rectangular box on the computer screen , and pressing a response button as soon as a yellow stimulus counter appeared , which stopped the counter and displayed the RT in milliseconds for a 1 s period .
ISIs varied randomly from 2 - 5 s .
Data acquisition for PVT - B resulted in N = 888 completed tests , which was 100 % of the data sought .
To analyze time in mission effects , mixed model ANOVAs ( Proc Mixed , SAS Version 9.3 , SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC ) with a random intercept for crewmembers and unstructured covariance were performed with mission quarter ( MQ ) as the only explanatory variable ( MQ 1 , days 1 - 130 ; MQ 2 , days 131 - 260 ; MQ 3 , days 261 - 390 ; MQ 4 , days 391 - 520 ) and with the scores from the mood scales ( BDI - II and POMS - SF ) and visual analog scales as outcome variables .
Although we could have justified many different hypotheses relative to time in mission ( e.g. , steadily increasing or decreasing effects , third quarter effect ) , we chose to keep our hypothesis as generic as possible ( null hypothesis : no difference between mission quarters ) .
This was partially driven by findings on the activity data that showed a steep decline in activity initially , a slow but steady decline during the second and third mission quarters , and a sharp rise at the end of the mission , which conformed to neither of the two above - stated hypotheses [19] .
Our mixed model analyses took the clustered nature of the data into account and used all available data points based on repeated measures within subjects ( N = 444 for measures sampled only in the morning or in the evening and N = 888 for measures sampled both in the morning and the evening ) .
The models for outcomes sampled both in the morning and the evening were also controlled for administration time ( morning or evening ) .
If a type 3 test indicated a significant MQ effect ( P < 0.05 ) , post - hoc tests comparing each MQ with each other MQ were performed .
Post - hoc tests were Bonferroni corrected for Type I error inflation ( α = 0.05 / 6 = 0.0083 ) .
To investigate individual differences between crewmembers , ANOVAs ( Proc Mixed in SAS ) were performed with crewmember as the only explanatory variable and with the scores from the mood scales ( BDI - II and POMS - SF ) and visual analog scales as outcome variables .
Again , models with visual analog scale variables sampled twice daily were also controlled for administration time ( morning or evening ) .
If a Type 3 test indicated a significant crewmember effect ( P < 0.05 ) , post - hoc tests comparing data from each crewmember with data from each of the other crewmembers were performed .
Post - hoc tests were Bonferroni corrected for Type I error inflation ( α = 0.05 / 15 = 0.0033 ) .
For ease of interpretation , all scales were transformed to a 0 to 100 range in Tables 1 and 2 .

POMS : Profile of Mood States Short Form ; ICC : Intra - class Correlation ; * indicates that the respective crewmember answered 0 on all items throughout the whole mission .
To investigate changes of individual differences with time in mission , graphs plotting cumulative scores of mood and visual analog scale outcomes relative to time in mission were generated for those variables with a significant ( P < 0.05 ) main effect for mission quarter .
To further investigate individual differences , we calculated intra - class correlations ( ICC ) for each outcome measure as the ratio of between - subjects variance to the sum of the between - and within - subjects variances .
The ICC is based on variance components analysis , involving the explicit separation of within - subjects variance and between - subjects variance in data derived from repeated measurements in individuals .
The ICC expresses the proportion of variance in these data that is explained by systematic inter - individual variability .
Stability of ICC values was interpreted using the following ranges : “ slight ” ( 0.0 - 0.2 ) ; “ fair ” ( 0.2 - 0.4 ) ; “ moderate ” ( 0.4 - 0.6 ) ; “ substantial ” ( 0.6 - 0.8 ) ; and “ almost perfect ” ( 0.8 - 1.0 ) [20] .
We compared actigraphy scorings across subjects on a minute per minute basis .
One minute epochs that were classified as missing or off - wrist for at least one crewmember were excluded from the analysis ( 86,068 min or 11.5 % of the 520 - day period ) .
For each crewmember , those minutes were counted where the crewmember was either the only crewmember sleeping or the only crewmember active awake .
We then calculated the cumulative time for both categories corrected for the amount of missing data ( i.e. , relative to the full 520 - day or 12,480 - h mission ) .
These studies were approved by a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee .
Participants signed and received separate consent forms for the mass testing and analytic thinking surveys , which were all completed online .
All participants indicated their willingness to consent via button press .
Participants received course credit for the mass testing and analytic thinking surveys .
Participants completed a series of reasoning problems and cognitive ability measures as part of a larger project on the everyday consequences of analytic thinking ( see [2] ) .
This includes , but is not limited to , religious belief .
All participants were University of Waterloo students who signed up for a study on “ thinking styles and reasoning ” online through the participant pool .
The only exclusion criteria was that participants had to have completed the department - wide mass - testing and pre - screen questionnaires prior to signing up for the thinking styles study ( not every student in the participant pool completes one or both of these questionnaires ) .
Participants were not permitted to sign up for the study more than once ( i.e. , someone who participated in Study 1 was not permitted to sign up for Studies 2 - 4 in the subsequent semesters ) .
Demographic characteristics of the participants can be found in Table 1 .

a One participant did not indicate their gender .
We had complete data for 381 participants .
At the end of the analytic thinking survey ( but not in the mass testing or pre - screen surveys ) , participants were given an attention check question .
The same instruction check was used for all four studies , with some slight variations ( see below ) .
For this , they were presented with a list of common activities and , in the instruction box , it read : “ Below is a list of leisure activities . If you are reading this , please choose the ‘ other ’ box below and write ‘ I read the instructions ’ . ” Nine participants failed the instruction check and were excluded from subsequent analysis .
This left us with 372 participants ( see Table 1 ) .
We also asked participants if they had seen the CRT before and 77 participants ( 20.7 % ) responded affirmatively .
Their data were retained but analyses are reported with and without these participants .
Study 1 was completed in the winter term of 2013 .
A subset of the data from Study 1 , 3 , and 4 were previously published in an investigation of CRT scoring strategies [15] .
For this , participants who completed the analytic thinking survey were permitted to complete a second survey with analytic thinking disposition measures and this subset of participants are included in Pennycook et al . [15] .
In the current studies , the full sample is included and additional data from thinking disposition questionnaires is reported in S2 Text .
The results for the thinking disposition questionnaires parallel our performance - based findings .
We had complete data for 158 participants .
Nine participants failed the instruction check and were excluded from subsequent analysis .
This left us with 149 participants ( see Table 1 ) , 20.7 % ( N = 31 ) of which responded affirmatively when asked if they have seen the CRT before .
Study 2 was completed in the spring term of 2013 .
We had complete data for 406 participants .
The attention check was made more difficult for Studies 3 and 4 by inserting an introductory screen prior to the instruction check that said : “ For the final part of the study , we are interested in the types of things that you do in your spare time ” .
This had a large effect : 127 participants failed and were excluded from subsequent analysis .
This left us with 279 participants ( see Table 1 ) , 21.5 % ( N = 60 ) of which responded affirmatively when asked if they have seen the CRT before .
Study 3 was completed in the fall term of 2013 .
Components of this data set were also previously published in an investigation of analytic thinking and smartphone use [9] .
We had complete data for 398 participants .
One hundred and thirty one participants failed the instruction check and were excluded from subsequent analysis .
This left us with 267 participants ( see Table 1 ) , 25.1 % ( N = 67 ) of which responded affirmatively when asked if they have seen the CRT before .
Study 4 was completed in the winter term of 2014 .
All items can be found in S3 Text .
A breakdown of the materials for each study can be found in Table 2 .
Base - rate neglect problems , used in Studies 1 and 2 , were replaced with a longer heuristics and biases battery in Studies 3 and 4 .

CRT = Cognitive Reflection Test .
a The additional CRT questions in Study 1 ( N = 3 ) differed from those used in Studies 3 and 4 ( N = 4 ; see S3 Text .
The religious belief scale from the mass testing survey included statements about eight conventional religious beliefs ( Pennycook et al . [22] , Study 2 ) : heaven , hell , miracles , afterlife , angels , demons , soul , and the devil / Satan . Participants indicated their agreement / disagreement with the statements ( where agreement meant that they held the belief in question ) on the following 5 - point scale : 1 ) I strongly disagree , 2 ) I disagree , 3 ) I don ’ t know , 4 ) I agree , 5 ) I strongly agree .
The scale had good internal consistency : Cronbach ’ s α = 0.94 in each of the four studies and in the combined data set .
Participants also indicated the ‘ type ’ of God that they believed in on a 7 point scale [4] : 1 ) A personal God , 2 ) God as an impersonal force , 3 ) A God who created everything , but does not intervene in human affairs [ Deism ] , 4 ) Don ’ t know whether or not any Gods exist [ Negative Agnostic ] , 5 ) Don ’ t know whether or not any Gods exist and no one else does either [ Positive Agnostic ] , 6 ) I don ’ t believe in Gods of any sort [ Negative Atheist ] , and 7 ) I believe that God does not exist [ Positive Atheist ] .
To ease exposition , a theism measure was created by combining theists ( options 1 - 3 ) , agnostics ( options 4 & 5 ) , and atheists ( options 6 & 7 ) .
For the religious affiliation question in the pre - screen survey , participants were presented with a list of religious affiliations and asked to select the option that they most strongly identified with .
The list included the following options : Agnostic , Atheist , Baha ’ i , Buddhist , Chinese Traditional , Christian , Christian ( specifically Catholic ) , Christian ( specifically Protestant ) , Hindu , Humanist , Jewish , Muslim , No religion , Sikh , Taoist , and Other / not listed .
Across the entire data set ( i.e. , Studies 1 - 4 combined ) , 13.3 % ( N = 142 ) of the sample selected agnostic , 12.5 % ( N = 133 ) selected atheist , 16 % ( N = 171 ) of the sample chose ‘ no religion ’ , 42 % ( N = 448 ) of the sample selected one of the three Christian options , 14.8 % ( N = 149 ) chose a non - Christian religious affiliation .
The remaining 2.2 % ( N = 24 ) did not provide a response and were excluded from the affiliation analysis .
Multiple measures of analytic cognitive style were included across the four studies .
Each measure is intended to cue an incorrect intuitive response that requires additional analytic processing to override .
The original 3 - item CRT [14] was included in each study .
Additional CRT items were added for Studies 1 , 3 , and 4 .
Three items were added for Study 1 and four items were added for Studies 3 and 4 [17] .
In Studies 1 and 2 , we also included 6 incongruent base - rate neglect problems [22] .
These problems were intermixed with 6 congruent and 6 neutral problems .
The following is an incongruent problem [31] : In a study 1000 people were tested .
Among the participants there were 995 nurses and 5 doctors .
Paul is a randomly chosen participant of this study .
Paul is 34 years old .
He lives in a beautiful home in a posh suburb .
He is well spoken and very interested in politics .
He invests a lot of time in his career .
What is most likely ? ( a ) Paul is a nurse . ( b ) Paul is a doctor.Base - rate neglect refers to the propensity for individuals to underweight or ignore the base - rate information ( i.e. , 995 nurses / 5 doctors ) in lieu of the more intuitive stereotypical information ( i.e. , Paul more closely resembles the stereotype of a doctor than a nurse ) .
Incongruent problems contain a conflict between base - rate and stereotype ( as above ) whereas both sources of information suggest the same response for congruent problems .
Neutral problems do not contain stereotypes in the personality description .
The proportion of base - rate responses for incongruent problems has been shown to correlate negatively with religious belief in prior work [ 4 , 22 ] .
Finally , in Studies 3 and 4 , a 14 - item battery of heuristics and biases problems was administered [ 9 , 10 , 16 , 17 ] .
The battery included problems such as the conjunction fallacy and the gambler ’ s fallacy .
Measures of cognitive ability were included as control variables in each of the four studies .
For this , a 12 - item verbal intelligence test ( the “ Wordsum ” [32] ) was administered in each study .
Participants also completed a 3 - item numeracy test [33] in Studies 1 , 3 , and 4 .
This was increased to a 5 - item test in Study 2 [34] .
The religious belief scale was administered in online mass testing surveys with a number of different scales .
These scales differed across the four studies ( see S1 Text for a breakdown ) , but their order within the mass testing survey was always randomized .
The religious affiliation question always came after a set of demographic questions taken in an online pre - screen questionnaire .
Participants first completed the base - rate neglect / heuristics and biases problems ( depending on which study , see Table 2 ) , followed by numeracy and the CRT .
The Wordsum was always administered last .
Participants had to complete the mass testing and pre - screen surveys before they were eligible to sign up for the primary analytic thinking survey .
The vast majority of participants completed the analytic thinking survey on a different day than the mass testing and / or pre - screen surveys .
However , a relatively small proportion did complete the analytic thinking survey on the same day as the mass testing ( 8.5 % of the sample ) or pre - screen ( 3.9 % of the sample ) surveys .
Nonetheless , there was nothing linking the analytic thinking survey to any individual measure within the mass testing or pre - screen batteries and the results are essentially identical for participants who completed the surveys on the same day ( see S4 Text ) .
We therefore retained the full sample in the following analyses .
All participants gave written informed consent , and the study was approved by the local ethics committees in the participating countries and the Internal Review Board of the International Agency for Research on Cancer .
The design and methods of the InterAct case - cohort study have previously been described [9] .
InterAct is a case - cohort study nested within the EPIC cohort , and the project involves 29 institutions in nine European countries .
Ascertainment of incident T2D involved a review of the existing EPIC datasets at each centre using multiple sources of evidence including self - report , linkage to primary - care registers , secondary - care registers , medication use ( drug registers ) , hospital admissions , and mortality data .
Information from any follow - up visit or external evidence with a date later than the baseline visit was used .
To increase the specificity of the case definition , we sought further evidence for all cases with information on incident T2D from fewer than two independent sources , including seeking information via individual medical records review in some centres .
Cases in Denmark and Sweden were not ascertained by self - report , but identified via local and national diabetes and pharmaceutical registers , and hence all ascertained cases were considered to be verified .
Follow - up was censored at the date of diagnosis , 31 December 2007 , or the date of death , whichever occurred first .
All ascertained cases with any evidence of diabetes at baseline were excluded .
Prevalent diabetes was identified on the basis of baseline self - report of a history of diabetes , doctor - diagnosed diabetes , diabetes drug use , or evidence of diabetes after baseline with a date of diagnosis earlier than the baseline recruitment date .
A total of 340,234 participants of European descent were followed up for 3.99 million person - years ( mean [ range ] follow - up of 11.7 [ 0 - 17.5 ] y ) , during which 12,403 verified incident cases of T2D were identified [1] .
Individuals without stored blood ( n = 109,625 ) or without reported diabetes status ( n = 5,821 ) were excluded .
A centre - stratified , random sub - cohort of 16,835 individuals was selected .
After exclusion of 548 individuals with prevalent diabetes and 133 with unknown diabetes status , the sub - cohort included 16,154 individuals for analysis .
By design , because of the random selection , this sub - cohort also included a set of 778 individuals who developed incident T2D during follow - up .
Participants in the random sub - cohort were similar to all EPIC participants eligible for inclusion in InterAct [9] .
InterAct cases were followed - up for a mean ( standard deviation [ SD ] ) of 6.9 ( 3.3 ) y , and 49.8 % were men .
The overall incidence of T2D in InterAct was 3.8 per 1,000 person - years of follow - up .
Weight and height were measured with participants not wearing shoes and in light clothing or underwear in the majority of centres [10] .
Waist circumference ( WC ) was measured either at the narrowest circumference of the torso or at the midpoint between the lower ribs and the iliac crest .
Hip circumference was measured horizontally at the level of the largest lateral extension of the hips or over the buttocks .
For a subset of the Oxford participants ( n = 363 ) , only self - reported waist and hip circumferences were available .
Each participant ' s body weight and waist and hip circumferences were corrected for the clothing worn during measurement in order to reduce heterogeneity due to protocol differences among centres .
Correction included adjustment for self - reporting in Oxford participants using a prediction equation based on a comparison of self - reported and measured data in a sample of 5,000 of the Oxford general population [10] , [11] .
Body mass index ( BMI ) was calculated as weight ( kg ) / height ( m ) squared .
Waist - hip ratio was calculated and expressed as a percentage .
Measures of waist and hip circumference were not performed in Umea , Sweden ( n = 1,845 ) , and were missing in an additional 173 and 193 InterAct participants , respectively [12] .
Standardised information was collected by questionnaire at baseline on education , smoking status [13] , and diabetes family history [14] .
Physical activity was based on a brief questionnaire covering occupation and recreational activity , which was summarised into an ordered categorical overall physical activity index ( inactive , moderately inactive , moderately active , and active ) that has been validated in the populations participating in EPIC [15] , [16] .
In one of the centres ( Umea , Sweden ) , a slightly different questionnaire was used to assess physical activity .
From this questionnaire we derived a four - category index similar to that derived from all other study locations based on two questions on occupational and leisure time physical activity [16] .
Usual food intake was estimated using country - specific validated dietary questionnaires .
Estimated individual nutrient intakes were derived from foods included in the dietary questionnaires through the standardised EPIC Nutrient Database [17] .
Participants in the lowest and highest 1 % of the cohort distribution of the ratio of reported total energy intake to energy requirement were excluded from the current study ( n = 736 ) .
The Mediterranean dietary pattern as used here is characterised by a high consumption of unrefined cereals , fruits , vegetables , olive oil , and legumes ; a moderate consumption of dairy products ( mostly cheese and yogurt ) ; moderate wine consumption ; a moderate - to - high consumption of fish ; and a low consumption of meat and meat products [18] , [19] .
Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the relative Mediterranean diet score that has previously been associated with the risk of incident T2D in InterAct [20] .
This score included nine nutritional components characteristic of the Mediterranean diet : seven potentially beneficial components ( vegetables , legumes , fruits and nuts , cereals , fish and seafood , olive oil , and moderate alcohol consumption ) and two potentially detrimental components ( meat and meat products , and dairy products ) .
The overall relative Mediterranean diet score was divided into categories reflecting low ( 0 - 6 points ) , medium ( 7 - 10 points ) , and high ( 11 - 18 points ) adherence to the Mediterranean diet on the basis of previously published cutoff points [21] .
DNA was not available for Danish ( n = 4,037 ) participants , leaving a total maximum sample size of 10,348 incident cases and 14,671 random sub - cohort participants with DNA available , including 13,394 non - diabetic InterAct sub - cohort participants .
Hence , of the original 27,779 InterAct participants , a maximum of 23,742 were eligible for genetic analyses .
Of these , a total of 19,651 participants , including 8,582 incident cases and 11,069 non - diabetic sub - cohort participants , had DNA available for genotyping ( Table S1 ) .
DNA was extracted from up to 1 ml of buffy coat for each individual from a citrated blood sample .
Standard procedures on an automated Autopure LS DNA extraction system ( Qiagen ) with PUREGENE chemistry ( Qiagen ) were used , and the DNA was hydrated overnight prior to further processing .
DNA samples were quantified by PicoGreen assay ( Quant - iT ) and normalised to 50 ng / μ l .
A total of 10,027 participants ( 4,644 cases ) were selected across all except the Danish centres for genome - wide genotyping using the Illumina 660W - Quad BeadChip at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute .
Samples were randomly selected from those successfully genotyped on Sequenom or Taqman platforms ( based on DNA concentration , call rate , and gender matching sex chromosome genotype ) , with the number of individuals selected per centre being proportional to the percentage of total cases in that centre .
Of these , a total of 9,431 samples passed quality control criteria following genome - wide genotyping ( call rate > 95 % , no conflict between gender and X chromosome heterozygosity , concordant candidate genotyping , not an outlier for autosomal heterozygosity or ethnicity ) , with 99.9 % and 99.5 % of included samples at call rates of 97 % and 99 % , respectively .
In addition , 9,794 InterAct participants with available DNA and not selected for genome - wide measurement were genotyped using the Illumina Cardio - Metabochip [16] .
Genotyping was completed in 9,467 InterAct samples , with 99.8 % and 98.2 % of samples at call rates of 97 % and 99 % , respectively .
Genotype information and quality metrics for the 49 T2D loci in the InterAct random sub - cohort are included in Table S4 .
Genotype distributions were in Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium using a Bonferroni - adjusted significance level of p < 0.001 , with the exception of rs 11063069 ( CCND 2 ) in the Illumina 660 W subset ( p = 7.84 × 10 − 13 ) .
We selected all top - ranked SNPs from loci reaching genome - wide significance for association with T2D in European - descent populations in the latest DIAGRAM meta - analysis [22] .
From a total of 66 reported T2D - associated variants , we excluded the DUSP 8 locus , which had a parent - of - origin - specific effect [23] , in addition to 15 variants that were significant genome - wide in Asian populations only .
The top - ranked SNP at DUSP 9 on the X chromosome was also unavailable and without a suitable proxy , and was therefore not included .
Hence , a total of 49 variants were selected for the InterAct genetic score , including two established obesity loci ( FTO and MC4R ) and two loci that reached genome - wide significance in sex - differentiated meta - analyses ( CCND 2 and GIPR ) [22] .
The top - ranked SNP at HNF1B ( rs 11651052 ) was not available on the Illumina 660 W - Quad BeadChip , and a proxy in high linkage disequilibrium ( rs 4430796 ; r 2 = 0.97 ) was used instead .
Risk alleles ( Table S4 ) were summed into a genetic risk score , including imputation of missing genotypes .
Characteristics of all InterAct participants and of the random sub - cohort are summarised , alongside those of individuals who had DNA available for genotyping , in Tables S2 and S3 , respectively .
Associations between the published T2D risk allele for each SNP ( Table S4 ) and incident T2D were estimated using Prentice - weighted Cox regression models , separately within each country , with age as the underlying time scale , adjusted for sex and centre and assuming additive genetic effects with the T2D risk allele as the effect allele [9] .
The hazard ratio ( HR ) for each SNP was combined across countries using random effects meta - analysis .
Sensitivity analyses were performed replacing centre by linearized ( i.e. , expressed in kilometres ) latitude and longitude of the centre [24] , [25] , and also with additional inclusion of BMI ( continuous ) in the sex - and centre - adjusted model .
A genetic risk score was constructed by summing the number of risk alleles across all 49 loci .
To maximise sample size , missing genotypes were imputed by assigning the mean genotype in the overall dataset at each locus for cases and non - cases separately .
This was done only for individuals successfully genotyped for at least 47 of the 49 loci , and allowed the inclusion of 18,890 rather than 18,390 individuals in analyses of the genetic score .
The HR for T2D per 1 - SD increase in the score ( SD calculated in the sub - cohort ) was estimated as described above .
Sensitivity analyses were performed using the original non - imputed genetic risk score , and also a weighted version of the two scores , where the weights for each SNP were equal to the log odds ratio for that SNP from DIAGRAM replication samples [22] .
Further sensitivity analyses were performed removing CCND 2 from the risk score , and also removing CCND 2 and GIPR ( identified in sex - differentiated meta - analyses ) specifically for the analysis of interaction with sex .
Meta - regression models were used to explore whether average age , BMI , or WC by country in the sub - cohort explained any of the heterogeneity between countries .
Interactions between the imputed , unweighted genetic risk score and each of the following risk factors previously shown to be associated with T2D in InterAct were assessed : sex [9] , diabetes family history [14] , BMI ( three levels : < 25 , 25 to < 30 , ≥ 30 kg / m2 ) [12] , WC ( three levels : men , < 94 cm [ 34.6 inches ] , 94 to < 102 cm [ 34.6 to < 40 inches ] , ≥ 102 cm [ ≥ 40 inches ] ; women , < 80 cm [ 31.5 inches ] , 80 to < 88 cm [ 31.5 to < 35 inches ] , ≥ 88 cm [ ≥ 35 inches ] ) [12] , age ( continuous ) [9] , physical activity ( four levels : inactive , moderately inactive , moderately active , active ) [26] , and Mediterranean diet score ( integer scale from 0 - 18 , included as a continuous variable ) [20] .
To estimate p - values for interaction with either the genetic risk score or individual SNPs , a parameter representing the interaction between the score or SNP and the variable of interest was included in country - specific Prentice - weighted Cox regression models , with additional adjustment for centre and sex and using age as the underlying time scale ( except for analyses of baseline age , where calendar time was used ) .
The interaction parameter estimates were then combined across countries using random effects meta - analysis , and observed versus expected p - values were plotted for individual SNP interactions ( Figure S1 ) .
Numerical p - values were included in tables and figures , but Bonferroni - adjusted levels of significance were used to draw inferences about statistical significance , to account for the number of tests performed for the score ( score by seven T2D risk factors , equivalent to seven tests , with p < 0.007 ensuring control of family - wise error rate at level α = 0.05 ) or individual SNPs ( 49 SNPs by seven T2D risk factors , equivalent to 343 tests , with p < 1.46 × 10 − 4 ensuring control of family - wise error rate at level α = 0.05 ) .
HRs were also calculated by level for each risk factor , as described above ( age at baseline < 50 , 50 to < 60 , ≥ 60 y ; Mediterranean diet score 0 - 6 , 7 - 10 , and 11 - 18 ) .
We additionally grouped T2D cases according to their age of diagnosis ( < 55 , 55 to < 65 , ≥ 65 y ) and fit different weighted Cox models using each of these groups as a separate outcome .
To estimate the cumulative incidence of T2D within strata defined by quartiles of the genetic risk score ( cutoffs derived from the distribution in the sub - cohort ) and modifiable risk factors , we used the Stata bsample command to recreate the full cohort by resampling with replacement from the sub - cohort , according to the distributions of the stratum variables within the sub - cohort .
This made it possible to estimate absolute cumulative incidences ( one minus the Kaplan - Meier estimate of the survivor function ) .
Papers included in the systematic review were retrieved from Medline ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed ) and ISI web of Knowledge ( http://wok.mimas.ac.uk/ ) using the search terms : “ Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ” and “ ALDH 2 ” in combination with “ Hypertension ” , “ Blood pressure ” , “ Cardiovascular diseases ” , “ Coronary disease ” , “ Heart disease ” , “ Coronary artery disease ” .
The bibliographies of retrieved articles were also scanned for relevant publications .
We searched for all papers published before October 2006 .
Screening of studies for inclusion was performed by two researchers ( LC , SJL ) independently of each other to increase objectivity .
We also searched for all studies of the ALDH 2 genotype regardless of outcome for use in separate analyses , and we scanned the abstracts of these studies to determine whether they may include any of the outcomes we were interested in .
If we were uncertain we scanned the paper and then contacted the authors .
There was no exclusion on the basis of language .
For multiple publications based on the same study , the latest publication was included .
For inclusion we required , as a minimum , data on systolic or diastolic blood pressure by genotype or prevalence of hypertension by genotype .
Where insufficient data for inclusion were available in the paper we contacted authors directly , and if sufficient information could still not be obtained the study was excluded .
A flow diagram showing the number of studies found in our search strategy , and reasons for exclusion is given in Figure 1 .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050052.g001 Flow Diagram Showing Reasons for Exclusion and Number of Papers Excluded We followed a standard protocol for data extraction .
For each study , the following data were recorded ( where available ) : first author ' s name , year of publication , country and city in which the study was performed , name of the study , study design , number and source of participants , sex , method of assessment of drinking status , categories of alcohol drinking , mean alcohol drinking and standard deviation by ALDH 2 genotype , distribution of potential confounding factors by genotype with p - values , distribution of genotypes among hypertensive and nonhypertensive participants , mean blood pressure and standard deviation by ALDH 2 genotype , and reported effect estimates ( i.e. , relative risks , odds ratios , or mean difference of blood pressure level ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for ALDH 2 genotype and hypertension risk .
Data extraction was carried out by two researchers ( LC , SJL ) independently of each other .
Data on alcohol intake were converted to a uniform measure of grams per day for comparison across all studies with 1 unit = 10 ml = 7.9 g [10] .
We calculated the unadjusted mean difference in blood pressure or the odds ratio of hypertension by comparing * 1 * 2 and * 1 * 1 to * 2 * 2 genotypes .
In the analyses of hypertension , fixed - effects meta - analysis was used to calculate summary odds ratio estimates , and in the analyses of diastolic and systolic blood pressure , mean differences between genotype groups were obtained .
We carried out fixed - effects meta - analyses separately for men and women , excluding two very small studies ( Nishimura [11] , n = 36 , and Mackenzie [12] , n = 28 ) that did not provide data separately by sex , and two further small studies [13,14] for which we were unable to obtain estimates of blood pressure separately for * 1 * 2 and * 2 * 2 genotypes .
All statistical analyses were carried out with the use of Stata statistical software ( version 9.2 ; Stata Corporation ) .
All statistical tests were two - sided .
We assessed evidence of small - study effects ( which may include publication bias ) for studies of ALDH 2 polymorphism and hypertension risk , and for ALDH 2 and blood pressure by computing both the Egger [15] and Begg [16] tests .
For the studies that reported both blood pressure and mean alcohol intake by genotype , we calculated estimates of the causal effect of alcohol on blood pressure , using the method of instrumental variables with genotype as the instrument assuming the effect is linear .
In order to use standard instrumental variable estimation methods ( ‘ two - stage least squares ' ) [17] the corr 2data command in Stata was used to construct an artificial dataset matching the reported number of participants with each genotype , and the means and standard deviations of alcohol intake and blood pressure within each genotype .
One study reported the mean but not the standard deviation of alcohol intake by genotype [18] , so it was estimated from a histogram .
As the correlation between alcohol intake and blood pressure within each genotype was not available , this correlation was assumed to be zero , which is slightly conservative , as the standard error of the estimated effect of alcohol on blood pressure reduces slightly as this correlation increases .
As a sensitivity analysis we repeated the analysis assuming a correlation of 0.2 in all genotypes and all studies .
Instrument strength was assessed using the first - stage F - statistic ; values considerably above 10 are generally taken to show sufficient instrument strength to ensure the validity of two - stage least - squares [17] .
The resulting estimates were then meta - analysed using the same methods as above .
No specific permissions were required for the 23 sample plots in this study .
We confirmed that the field studies did not involve endangered or protected species .
The specific location of the sample plots is provided in the manuscript ( Fig 1 ) .

The figure in the left bottom corner of Fig 1 is similar to Figure 1 in the reference [43] but not identical to the Figure 1 in the reference [43] .
The box in the left bottom corner refers to the South China Sea islands .
The field experiment was conducted at Xiaotangshan Precision Agriculture Experimental Base , Changping District , Beijing , North China ( 40 ° 10.6 ′ N , 116 ° 26.3 ′ E ) .
This experimental base has been operational since 2001 and is used for precision agriculture research .
This site is located in a warm temperate zone with a mean annual rainfall of 507.7 mm and a mean annual temperature of 13 ° C [44] .
The soil at this site is a silt - clay loam [44] .
The double cropping system of winter wheat ( Triticumaestivum L . ) and summer maize ( Zeamays L . ) is the farming practice at this site and is the dominant farming style in the North China Plain .
Winter wheat is usually sowed in October and harvested in June of the following year .
Approximately 10 cm - high wheat residuals are left on the field surface after harvest .
Summer maize is sowed in June without tillage and then harvested in October .
When precipitation is scarce , crops are irrigated depending on soil water status .
A very flat sample area was established at this site with slopes less than 1 ° and a size of 140 m × 100 m .
Land leveling was conducted in this sample area about 2 years ago ( November 2013 ) .
A single crop cultivar was then planted in this area , which is under uniform water and fertilizer management .
Before land leveling , the sample area was subjected to different treatments , such as using different fertilizers and crop cultivars to meet different research needs [44] , [45] , [46] .
Therefore , soil properties showed spatial variations in the sample area because of long - term differences in farm managements ( i.e. , fertilizer , irrigation and cultivar ) , which might have led to variations in the vegetation growth and Rs .
To determine the spatial variation of Rs , we employed a grid sampling method , where the distance between each sample plot was approximately 20 m ( Fig 1 ) .
This design was in accordance with the research results on spatial autocorrelation of soil properties at this site [45] .
The field experiments were conducted at two continuous sunny days at the late jointing stages of winter wheat ( April 20 to 22 , 2015 ) and summer maize ( August 3 to 5 , 2015 ) , which mostly corresponded to the period of the highest biological activity because of the maximum crop growth rate [18] .
On April 13 , 2015 , the sample plots were fully irrigated to meet the water requirements of winter wheat growth .
A heavy rain event occurred on July 27 , 2015 , approximately 1 week before the summer maize experiment .
Therefore , the soil water content was considered to be suitable for crop growth at the time when we conducted the two filed experiments .
Field experiments were conducted at 23 sample plots ( Fig 1 ) .
We conducted the summer maize experiment at the same sample plots where the winter wheat experiment was conducted using high - precision GPS positioning .
Each plot size was 1.5 m × 1.5 m .
In each plot , we measured the variables that might explain the spatial variation of Rs : these variables include ( 1 ) Rs ; ( 2 ) biotic factors measured by aboveground biomass ( AGB ) , leaf area index ( LAI ) , and canopy chlorophyll content ( Chlcanopy ) ; ( 3 ) environmental factors encompassing soil water content at 0 - 20 cm depth ( SWC 20 ) and soil temperature at 10 cm depth ( Ts 10 ) ; ( 4 ) soil property factors , including soil total nitrogen ( STN ) content , soil total carbon ( STC ) content , soil carbon / nitrogen ( C / N ) , and soil organic carbon ( SOC ) content ; and ( 5 ) canopy spectral reflectance of winter wheat and summer maize .
It is noteworthy that we only measured soil property factors during the winter wheat experiment because of the short interval between the winter wheat and summer maize experiment ( 3 months ) .
We assumed that the soil properties in such a short time could be considered constant .
Therefore , the measurement data for soil properties were used to analyze the spatial variation of Rs in the winter wheat and summer maize .
Measurements of soil respiration and environmental factors : In each sample plot , Rs was measured using a Rs chamber ( 6400 - 09 ; LiCor , Lincoln , Nebraska , USA ) connected to a portable photosynthesis system ( LI - 6400 ; LiCor , Lincoln , Nebraska , USA ) .
The Rs chamber was mounted on a PVC soil collar that was sharpened at the bottom .
Four soil collars were randomly distributed in each plot for the winter wheat experiment .
Six soil collars were installed in each plot for the summer maize experiment .
Each Rs measurement was performed between 09 : 00 h and 12 : 00 h ( local time ) because fluxes measured during this time interval usually represent the daily mean flux [18] .
Rs measurement procedures , soil collar placement , and Rs data processing were described in previous studies [18] , [43] .
After the Rs measurement on the PVC soil collar in each plot ( S1 Table ) , the soil temperature at 10 cm depth ( Ts 10 ) and soil moisture at 0 - 20 cm ( SM 20 ) were measured in the collar to minimize sample difference .
Detailed procedures for soil temperature and soil moisture measurements were previously described by Huang et al . [43] .
Canopy reflectance measurements and vegetation index calculation : Canopy reflectance was measured after the installation of soil collars .
A portable spectroradiometer ( FS - FR 2500 , ASD , USA ) was used to measure winter wheat and summer maize canopy radiance between 350 and 2500 nm with a 1 nm waveband width .
The procedures for canopy reflectance measurements were described in detail by Huang et al . [18] .
Based on the measured canopy reflectance data , three VIs , namely , normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI ) , red edge chlorophyll index ( CIred edge ) , and enhanced vegetation index ( EVI ) , were calculated to analyze their relationships to the biotic factors of winter wheat and summer maize .
Three formulas used for the calculation of these VIs were described by Huang et al . [18] .
LAI was measured with a LAI - 2000 plant canopy analyzer ( LI - COR Inc . , Lincoln , Nebraska , USA ) .
In each plot , five representative positions were selected for LAI measurement , and two repeated measurements were performed at each position .
Chlleaf was obtained with a portable chlorophyll meter ( SPAD - 502 , New Jersey , USA ) .
The Chlleaf measurement procedures and Chlcanopy calculation were described in detail by Huang et al . [18] .
AGB was measured by randomly harvesting the aboveground fresh winter wheat plants in three subplots ( 0.2 m × 0.2 m ) and three maize plants in each plot .
The fresh samples were oven dried at 65 ° C until the mass of the sample became constant .
AGB measurement damaged the samples .
Thus , we conducted this measurement when all the other measurements were finished .
To reduce spatial sampling and measurement errors , we averaged the LAI , Chlleaf , and AGB derived from each plot for both winter wheat and summer maize for further analysis .
Soil inside the four PVC collars in each plot was destructively sampled after measuring Rs , soil temperature , and soil moisture in the winter wheat experiment .
The collected soil samples were stored at room temperature and rapidly transported to the nearby laboratory ( approximately 200 meters from the sampling site ) for analysis .
Soil sampling procedures and soil sample processing were described elsewhere [43] .
SOC content was estimated by the standard Mebius method [47] .
STN and STC content were measured by an elemental analyzer ( Isoprime - EuroEA 3000 , Milan Italy ) .
Soil C / N was calculated from the ratio of the STC and STN content .
Correlation analysis was employed to examine the relationships among Rs , biotic factors , environmental factors , and soil properties .
The coefficient of variation ( CV ) was used to represent the spatial variation of Rs and its various affecting factors .
The relationships between biotic factors ( i.e. LAI , AGB , and Chlcanopy ) and VIs ( i.e. , NDVI , CIred edge , and EVI ) were examined using regression analysis .
The optimum VI was selected based on the determination coefficient ( R 2 ) .
Previous studies [45] , [46] revealed that soil properties in our experimental area exhibited spatial variance .
Spatial clustering of sample plots based on soil property factors is advisable to detect the possible confounding effects of soil properties on the relationship between Rs and other biotic or abiotic factors , and elucidate the relationship between Rs and VIs .
In the present study , cluster analysis was performed based on the soil property factors to quantify the similarity in the 23 sample plots .
Hanesch et al . [48] demonstrated that using all the variables causes over - information in cluster analysis and leads to insufficiently distinguishable samples from one another .
The high correlation among input variables will over - represent one variable and bias the cluster results [49] , [50] .
Correlation analysis of the soil properties ( Table 1 ) demonstrated that the SOC content highly correlated with the STN content ( Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient r = 0.83 , p < 0.001 ) and STC content ( r = 0.86 , p < 0.001 ) .
Soil C / N displayed no significant correlation ( p > 0.05 ) with the SOC , STN , and STC content ( Table 1 ) .
Therefore , the SOC content and soil C / N were considered in the cluster analysis .
Moitinho et al . [51] also demonstrated that SOC and soil C / N ratio are the two most important soil property variables that affect spatial variation of Rs in a sugarcane field .
Before cluster analysis , the variables were standardized using the methods of Jiang et al . [37] .
Based on the results of the cluster analysis , linear regression between Rs and optimal VI was used to detect the possible relationship between Rs and the photosynthesis proxy factor derived from remote sensing data in each cluster .
One - way ANOVA with the least significant difference ( LSD ) multiple comparison test was used to analyze differences in Rs , biotic factors , environmental factors , and soil properties among different clusters .
All the statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) .

We selected Baringo and Kitui Counties in Kenya as study sites , as these counties differ in socioeconomic and environmental conditions , mobile phone access and network coverage ( S1 Table ) .
Baringo County ( 0 ° 28 ’ N , 35 ° 59 ’ E ) is characterized by mixed crop - livestock farming systems in the highlands and pastoralism in the lowlands , and generally receives adequate rainfall for agriculture throughout the county [41] .
In Baringo , approximately 52 % of the population is below poverty line [42] , 30 % of children are stunted [43] , and 50 % of the population owns a mobile phone [16] .
Kitui County ( 1 ° 22 ’ S , 38 ° 23 ’ E ) is generally at lower elevation than Baringo and is dominated by agro - pastoralism with sorghum , millet , and small livestock .
There is inadequate rainfall for agriculture in the easternmost parts of the county .
Kitui has higher rates of poverty ( 60 % ) , child stunting ( 46 % ) , and lower mobile phone ownership ( 25 % ) , than Baringo ( see above references ) .
Study locations within each county were selected through a combination of purposeful and random sampling of administrative units .
We included all districts within each county ( Kitui has two districts and Baringo four ) .
Within each district in Kitui , we purposefully selected the divisions with the highest and lowest number of households .
From the two districts in Baringo with the highest population , we purposefully selected the divisions with the lowest number of households , while from the two districts with the lowest population , we selected the divisions with the highest number of households , for a total of four divisions in each county .
Within each division , we randomly chose two sublocations , for a total of 32 sublocations representing the economic and geographic variation within each county .
We tested data collection mode with two internationally - validated nutrition indicators : Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women ( MDD - W ) [44] and Minimum Acceptable Diet ( MAD ) for infants and young children [45] ( Table 1 ) .
MDD - W accesses the micronutrient adequacy in the diet of women of reproductive age , a critical predictor of both maternal and child nutrition .
MAD assesses the adequacy of Infant and Young Child Feeding ( IYCF ) based on both dietary diversity ( MDD ) and meal frequency ( MMF ) .
We also included a sociodemographic indicator , the Kenya Progress Out of Poverty Index ( PPI ) [46] as a wealth proxy to assess differences in mode effect on MDD - W and MAD by wealth .
The indicators can be collected in short surveys of approximately five minutes , do not rely on pictorial demonstrations of food groups , and are calculated on a scorecard methodology based on respondents ’ answers to several questions .
The indicators differ in target population , type of data generated in question response , and conversion of scores to population prevalence ( Table 1 ) .
To meet the threshold for adequate dietary diversity , participants must have consumed at least five food groups out of ten in the past 24 hours for MDD - W and four out of seven for MDD .
Recommended MMF is satisfied when either ( a ) breastfed infants less than nine months old eat at least twice a day , ( b ) breastfed infants older than nine months eat at least three times per day , or ( c ) non - breastfed infants regardless of age consume milk at least twice per day and other foods at least four times per day .
Both MDD and MMF criteria must be satisfied for MAD .
Finally , PPI raw scores are converted into below poverty - line ( defined as $ 1.25 / day ) likelihoods using nonlinear conversion tables [46] .
Thus , we were able to examine the equivalence between modes at three levels : population prevalence , individual indicator score , and responses to indicator subquestions .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0210050.t001 Summary of indicators .
Sector , target population , survey length , data type , and conversion of score to prevalence for indicators in this study .1 MMF is considered a conditional step function because the inflection point of the function depends on the age and breastfeeding status of the child .2 The type of function used to convert PPI score to poverty likelihood depends on the definition of poverty used ( e.g. national poverty line , $ 1.25 / day , etc . ) .
Two separate surveys were used concurrently for different target populations : MDD - W , PPI , and basic demography for women of reproductive age , and MAD , PPI and basic demography for adult caretakers of children aged 6 - 23.99 months .
We used a test - retest design with four treatment arms ( T1 - T4 ) to evaluate the effect of data collection mode on nutrition indicators ( Fig 1 ) .
In the main treatment arms T1 and T2 , participants were interviewed with both CATI and F2F modes .
We included two control arms to the experimental design .
For the first control arm ( T3 ) , participants were interviewed via F2F mode in both rounds to understand potential learning and / or temporal effects .
A fourth arm ( T4 ) of F2F interviews for respondents with no phone access was included for MDD - W , to better understand non - coverage bias in conducting studies via CATI .
Phone access was defined as owning a mobile phone or having access to one via intrahousehold sharing and was determined by asking potential participants .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0210050.g001 Experimental design.Test - retest mode experiment on two nutrition indicators , MDD - W and MAD .
Survey consisted of four treatment arms : two main treatment arms testing for mode differences , arm 3 controlling for temporal effects and arm 4 controlling for non - coverage bias .
Target sample sizes are indicated .
Participants were systematically assigned to treatment arms during the test round , whereby participants meeting the inclusion criteria for the indicators were alternately assigned to T1 and T2 , and every sixth house visited per day was assigned to T3 .
For participants in T1 ( CATI first ) , phone numbers were collected and participants were called the next day .
For participants in T2 and T3 , F2F interviews were conducted immediately .
In the retest round respondents were re - interviewed using the other mode , e.g. participants in T1 were relocated and interviewed F2F , while T2 participants were called via CATI .
Participants in T3 were reinterviewed using F2F ( Fig 1 ) .
The retest round occurred approximately nine days ( 8.7 ± 4.4 days ) following the first survey , accounting for activities such as market days that may have altered diet choices when possible .
G * Power [47] was used to calculate sample sizes to detect a mode bias of 1.5 in population prevalence using McNemar ’ s Exact Test for paired nominal data , assuming 25 % of participants would switch indicator status ( above or below threshold ) between rounds .
Although attrition rates in mobile surveys can vary dramatically with mode and location , for the sample size calculations we assumed a 15 % attrition rate as CATI and F2F have low attrition rates , and studies with only two rounds have lower attrition rates than panel surveys [14] .
For the power analyses , we used alpha = 0.2 and beta = 0.05 to minimize the rate of false equivalences .
The resulting target sample size was 1000 participants , which we split evenly into the T1 and T2 arms .
Control group sizes were chosen as 12.5 % or 125 respondents for F2F controls , and 20 % or 200 respondents for no - phone controls .
Thirty - two field enumerators ( 16 men and 16 women ) and eight phone ( 3 men and 5 women ) operators were recruited from local populations in Baringo and Kitui Counties to ensure familiarity with local languages , diets , and context .
Enumerators and operators were trained together for two days to standardize survey methodology and interpretation of responses .
To collect phone numbers and conduct F2F interviews , enumerator teams working simultaneously in Kitui and Baringo visited each identified sublocation in sequence .
In each sublocation , enumerators sampled households semi - randomly , as enumerators traveled between households on foot , but were located in different parts of the sublocation , and did not sample adjacent households .
Household sampling continued until 70 suitable households were identified for participation in the experiment .
Only one participant was interviewed per household .
Both enumerators and operators used the same survey instrument , Enketo ( Ona , Nairobi , Kenya and Washington , DC , USA ) , based on the Open Data Kit platform [48] , to collect survey data .
Operators used Enketo ’ s web form on desktops in United Nations World Food Programme ’ s in - house call center in Nairobi to conduct CATI interviews , while enumerators used a similar offline platform on tablets for the face - to - face surveys in the field .
All data were uploaded daily to a centralized ODK server from where raw data was then extracted and analyzed .
We use F2F results as the “ control ” scores and CATI scores as the “ treatment ” , as F2F is the standard mode of nutrition data collection .
We evaluated effect of data collection mode in several ways .
First , paired t - tests evaluated mean score as a function of mode for participants that received both CATI and F2F modes .
At the population level , Kolmogorov - Smirnov tests compared distributional differences ( mean , variance , skew and kurtosis ) of indicator scores between modes .
Equivalence Tests [49] against varying levels of difference assessed if differences by mode were clinically significant ( large enough in magnitude to alter a nutritionist ’ s interpretation of the resultant data ) .
Linear mixed - effects models were used to examine survey methodology effects on nutrition scores , such as mode bias , enumerator bias [50] , or temporal effects .
Using a top - down approach [51] , we first used the most complex fixed effects of interest ( a three - way interaction between survey mode , round and enumerator gender ) and found the optimal structure for the random effects ( such as county and enumerator ) .
Then , using the resulting random effects , we determined the optimal fixed - effects structure .
For model selection we computed both Akaike ’ s Information Criterion ( AIC ) and the Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC ) .
Both AIC and BIC reward model explanatory power and penalize model complexity , but BIC also accounts for the number of observations in the dataset [51] .
Where AIC and BIC disagreed on the best - fit model , we chose the model with the lowest AIC , in order to guard against false negatives ( e.g. declaring there in no effect of survey mode when there may be ) .
Differences in responses to indicator component questions at the individual level were examined via McNemar ’ s Exact Test and paired t - tests for categorical and continuous data respectively .
Resulting p values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method [52] .
Non - coverage bias was assessed by comparing dietary diversity , PPI , and demographic data between the phone access and no phone access groups in the retest round for MDD - W .
The magnitude of the non - coverage bias , or the relative change in population - level estimates of dietary diversity by only surveying women with mobile phones , was estimated as RelativeBias = N2N 1 ( Y - 1 - Y - 2 ) Y - 1 Where Y - 1 and Y - 2 are the mean MDD - W scores for women with and without phone access , respectively , and ( N2N 1 ) is the proportion of women without access to mobile phones [53] .
We estimated mobile phone access in our population from published sources [ 16 , 35 ] .
All data analyses were conducted in R [54] .
The study protocol received research clearance and ethical approval from Kenya ’ s National Commission for Science , Technology and Innovation ( NACOSTI ) , as well as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM ) .
All methods were performed in accordance with NACOSTI and LSHTM guidelines .
For all participants , oral informed consent was obtained by the enumerator and / or operator before beginning each survey .
All efforts were made to ensure confidentiality of the participants .
The data were stored in a password - protected computer and made accessible only to the core study team members .
The analyses are presented in an aggregate format , phone numbers have been deleted , and all data has been anonymized .
No incentives or remunerations were given for participation in this study .
For the first part of the study , we calculated the minimum number of participants ( n = 46 ) for a correlational study ( power = .80 ) with a medium effect size ( r = 0.40 ) .
The hypothetical match group comprised 59 Argentinean participants ( 30 women ) , ranging between 20 and 60 years old ( M = 31.15 , SD = 10.18 ) .
These subjects completed an anonymous on - line survey ( sent via Facebook and e - mail ) including an hypothetical game circumstance .
To diversify the sample we asked participants to send the survey to friends .
There were no incentives for the participants to complete the survey .
This study was completed during the 9th and 10th of December , 2015 .
For the second part of the study , during the 2016 edition of the Copa America , 120 Argentinean participants completed the same survey in which the same scenario was presented right after the event occurred in the real match .
Participants completed the survey four days after the real match ( 12th of June , 2016 ) .
All responders were recruited by the same procedure as in the first part of the study .
To avoid possible confounds of repetition effects , we only called participants who had have not answered the first survey .
To this aim , we included a question about whether the participants had completed a survey about preferences in football from our laboratory and excluded those who responded affirmatively .
In order to control demographic variables among the groups we excluded six participants that were outside from the age - range of the first sample ( hypothetical match group ) .
In our original design we wanted to conform a group of participant who have heard about the game or watched the repetition of the goal .
Unfortunately , we only recruited 14 participants for this group and thus we decided to exclude them from data analyses .
The final sample for the second part of the study includes 38 participants ( 23 women , M = 32.52 years - old , SD = 10.90 ) who hand neither watched nor heard about the game ( did not watch the match group ) and 61 participants ( 25 women , M = 31.52 years - old , SD = 9.34 ) who had watched the match live ( watched the match group ) .
No differences were observed between groups in terms of age ( F ( 2 , 155 ) = 0.23 , p = .795 ) , education ( F ( 2 , 155 ) = 0.03 , p = .966 ) , or gender ( χ 2 = 3.66 , p = .160 ) ( see details in Table 1 ) .

All participants gave written informed consent and the study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee : “ Comite de Etica del Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas ( CEMIC ) ” qualified by the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS , USA ) : IRb 00001745 - IORG 0001315 .
Before the real game , the hypothetical match group responded to a short survey that included the following hypothetical football match between Brazil ( Argentina ’ s long - standing rival ) and Peru ( a relatively less competitive third team ) : “ Brazil and Peru are playing a football match . The match is decisive for the both teams ’ chances of advancing to the next round .
Brazil will make it to the next round with a draw or a win , and Peru will only classify if they win .
The match is tied 0 - 0 when , close to the end , the referee concedes Peru an illicit goal .
With this goal , Peru wins the match and Brazil is eliminated from the playoffs ” .
We asked participants how much pleasure they felt for the Brazilian team ’ s defeat ( Direct schadenfreude , DS ) and how much pleasure they felt for Peru ’ s victory ( Indirect schadenfreude , IS ) .
Six months after the first study , Brazil and Peru met .
Nearly exactly as described in the hypothetical scenario , Brazil just needed a draw and Peru had to win in order to qualify to the next stage of tournament .
Unexpectedly , 15 minutes before the end of the match the referee gave an illicit goal to Peru .
This goal signaled the qualification of Peru to the next round and the elimination of Brazil from the tournament .
This event received substantial media attention ( see : https://goo.gl/rPxN7a ) .
Four days after the real match we presented a very similar survey in a new population : “ This is a real event that happened few days ago during the Copa America : Brazil and Peru played a match that defined who would advance to the next round and who would be eliminated .
Brazil will make it with a draw or a win , and Peru will only classify if they win .
The match was tied 0 - 0 when , 15 minutes before the end , the referee conceded an illicit goal to Peru that was not ( was with the hand ) .
With this goal , Peru won the match and Brazil was eliminated from the Copa America ” .
We included the same questions of the first survey .
Furthermore , participants were asked to indicate whether they had ( 1 ) watched the game , ( 2 ) heard about the game or watched a replay of the goal , or ( 3 ) not watch the game .
In both surveys we also included questions to assess relevant predictors of schadenfreude , as reported in previous studies [18,20] .
We asked how much participants were identified with the Argentinean national team ( in - group identification ) and their degree of “ loathing ” for the Brazilian national team ( out - group dislike ) .
Responses were given in a 10 - point scale ( 1 = not at all ; 10 = very much ) .
We observed no significant differences among groups in these variables ( in - group identification : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 4.24 , p = .120 ; out - group dislike : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 4.54 , p = .79 ; see details in Table 1 ) suggesting that the three groups were similar regarding alternative explanations of schadenfreude .
In the last part of the survey we included two control questions to test whether participants differed in their dispositional tendency to like unfair goals .
To this end , we used a famous illicit goal scored by Diego Maradona ( a famous Argentinean football player ) against England in the quarter - finals of FIFA ’ s 1986 World Cup .
This goal is known worldwide as “ the Hand of God ” .
First , we asked whether participants remembered this goal .
In each group , more than 80 % of the sample remembered the goal ( see details in Table 1 ) .
Second , we asked how much participants liked Maradona because of this goal and how morally acceptable his action was .
We observed no significant differences in these measures among the three groups ( Appreciation for Maradona : χ 2 ( 2 ) = .21 , p = .941 , and moral judgment about the unfair goal : χ 2 ( 2 ) = 2.78 , p = .249 , see details in Table 1 ) .
These results suggest that the three groups were also similar regarding their dispositional tendency to like unfair goals .
Since the ordinal measures were not normally distributed , we analyzed them via non - parametric statistics .
First , Spearman ’ s Rho test was used to test the association between both schadenfreude measures in each group .
Second , to contrast differences in schadenfreude among the three groups , we used a Kruskal - Wallis test and U Mann - Whitney test for pair - wise group comparisons .
Third , to test whether schadenfreude was partially explained by the degree of out - group dislike and in - group identification , we conducted two separate ordinal regression analyses which included both schadenfreude measures as dependent variables and group as a categorical factor .
To test whether the relationship between schadenfreude and its predictors varied between groups we analyzed the interaction effects between the group factor and each predictor .
The α value for all statistical tests was set at .05 .
Cohen ’ s d ( d ) was used as a measure of effect size for significant effects .

The complete promoter region was cloned in two steps .
Promoters 1 and 2 were first cloned together using an internal XhoII site .
To incorporate Promoter 3 to this construct a longer fragment ( nucleotides − 1838 to 110 ) was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides 5 ′ - GGTCTAGAACCACATTTGTGTGAATTTGATTG - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - GGTCTAGACTTGATGAGTGGCCAAAACC - 3 ′ .
This fragment was added to the Promoter 1 + promoter 2 fragment using an internal NdeI site .
Histochemistry and determination of β - galactosidase acivity : Cells transformed with the different reporter vectors were allowed to develop on Nitrocellulose filters for the periods or time indicated in each experiment .
Structures were fixed , permeabilized and β - galactosidase activity was detected by hydrolysis of the X - Gal ( 5 - Bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl β - D - galactopyranoside ) as previously described [40] .
Spores were collected from structures developed on Nitrocellulose filters for 24 hours , fixed and permeabilized before detection of β - galactosidase activity as previously described [40] .
β - galactosidase activity was also determined in extracts obtained at different developmental times .
2 × 107 cells were developed on Nitrocellulose filters , collected and lysed in Z Buffer ( 60 mM Na2HPO 4 ; 40 mM NaH2PO 4 , 10 mM KCl ; 1 mM MgSO 4 , pH : 7.0 ) containing 0.2 % NP 40 ( Nonidet P40 ) .
The enzymatic activity was determined by incubation of the extracts in Z Buffer containing 0.88 mg / ml of the ONPG ( 2 - Nitrophenyl β - D - galactopyranoside ) substrate .
The amount of ONPG hydrolyzed was estimated by optical absorption at 410 nm and normalized to the amount of protein present in each sample .
Determination of mRNA levels by quantitative RT - PCR : RNA was isolated from 2 × 107 cells , either at growth or after development on Nitrocellulose filters for the times indicated in each experiment , using the TRI reagent ( Sigma - Aldrich , Inc , St Louis , MO , USA ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions .
cDNAs were generated from 1 μ g of total RNA using gene - specific oligonucleotides as primers .
cDNAs were used as substrates for quantitative real - time PCR reactions using as primers the oligonucleotides used for cDNA synthesis and a second oligonucleotide from the upstream region of each transcript .
In the case of the acaA mRNAs , the oligonucleotide 5 ′ - GGAGATCTACCACCACCATTTCCATCATG - 3 ′ , complementary to nucleotides 90 to 110 of the gene , encoded in Exon 2 , was used for cDNA synthesis and as reverse primer for PCR amplification .

500 ng / mL of heat - denatured riboprobe were used for hybridization and colour reaction was stopped after 2 ( streams ) to 5 ( culminants ) hours .
Pictures were taken ( 60X ) with a camera ( DFC 420 Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) attached to a stereo - microscope ( MZ 95 Leica Microsystems ) .
Both sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription and digoxigenin labelling of the complete acaA ORF ( kindly supplied by P . Schaap ) using a DIG RNA labelling kit ( Roche Diagnostics Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol .
Subject recruitment and data collection for CHD GENES have been described [11] .
Briefly , subjects were recruited from five main sites ( Children ’ s Hospital of Philadelphia , Columbia University Medical Center , Harvard Medical School including Boston Children ’ s Hospital and Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital , Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , and Yale School of Medicine ) and four satellite sites ( Children ’ s Hospital of Los Angeles , Cohen Children ’ s Medical Center , University College London , and University of Rochester Medical Center ) from December 2010 through November 2014 .
Recruitment methods were center - specific , but generally included ascertainment of cases at the time of hospital admission or an outpatient visit .
The study protocol was approved by an Institutional Review Board for each site .
All study participants ( or their parent / guardian ) provided written informed consent .
The Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston approved the study protocol for the data analyzed and presented in this article .
Patients with any diagnosis of CHD ( except as noted below ) , regardless of sex , age , and race / ethnicity were eligible to participate .
Patients with a genetic diagnosis were eligible to participate , but preference for enrolling such patients may have varied across study sites .
Patients with isolated patent foramen ovale , prematurity - related isolated patent ductus arteriosus , pulmonary stenosis related to a twin - twin transfusion , and cardiomyopathy without a CHD were not eligible .
Cardiac diagnoses were confirmed by review of imaging ( e.g. , echocardiogram ) and operative reports .
Information on genetic testing , genetic physical exams , and extracardiac malformations was abstracted from medical records .
In addition , information on cases and their parents was obtained during subject and family interviews .
Cases that did not participate in the interviews were excluded from this report .
Data collected by interview included race / ethnicity , sex , birth weight , and maternal and paternal ages at the time of the cases ’ birth .
Data were also collected on maternal characteristics , including pre - pregnancy height and weight ( to calculate pre - pregnancy body mass index ) , pre - gestational diabetes , gestational diabetes , epilepsy or seizure during pregnancy , and education level .
For cases who were ≤ 1 year of age at recruitment , interview data were also collected on maternal smoking and alcohol use during the first trimester , any folic acid supplementation six months before pregnancy , and parity .
For cases who were > 1 year at recruitment , the interview included questions related to neurodevelopmental outcomes ( e.g. , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , autism spectrum ) .
CHD diagnoses assigned using the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Codes ( http://www.ipccc.net/ ) were manually reviewed by two of the authors ( S.E and E.G . ) and cases were assigned to one of seven types of CHDs : laterality disorder ( LAT ) , conotruncal heart defect ( CTD ) , atrioventricular septal defect ( AVCD ) , left ventricular outflow tract obstruction ( LVOT ) , right ventricular outflow tract obstruction ( RVOT ) , atrial septal defect ( ASD ) , and other .
These groups are based on subsets of lesion that are thought to share genetic and mechanistic underpinnings and are defined in Table 1 .
Cases were categorized using a hierarchical approach .
First , cases with a laterality disorder , regardless of other findings , were placed in LAT .
Next , cases with abnormal conotruncal anatomy ( including specific subtypes of isolated ventricular septal defects ) , regardless of associated left or right sided obstruction or atrioventricular canal anomalies , were placed in CTD .
Then , cases with atrioventricular canal abnormalities with normally related great arteries were categorized as AVSD and cases with left or right sided obstructive lesions with normally related great arteries and normal atrioventricular canals were assigned to LVOT or RVOT , respectively .
Finally , cases with an isolated secundum or sinus venosus type atrial septal defect were assigned to ASD .
Cases with any other CHD diagnosis were assigned to the other group .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0191319.t001 Diagnostic types of congenital heart defect in the Pediatric Cardiac Genetic Consortium Cohort .
a Does not include variants of hypoplastic left heart syndrome such as malaligned atrioventricular canal defect or double outlet right ventricle with mitral atresia .
Based on data from the interviews and medical records , cases were classified as either having 1 ) an identified genetic diagnosis ( i.e. a syndrome or genetic alteration thought to explain the associated CHD ) , or 2 ) no genetic diagnosis .
For simplicity , we refer to such cases as “ syndromic ” and “ nonsyndromic ” , respectively .
Cases classified as nonsyndromic by this scheme may have had additional non - cardiac anomalies or reported neurodevelopmental deficits .
For syndromic cases , we reported counts and frequencies for each specific diagnosis .
Given the clinical heterogeneity within this group , we excluded syndromic cases from subsequent analyses .
For nonsyndromic cases , parental characteristics , case characteristics , and parent - reported neurodevelopmental outcomes were described using counts and frequencies for discrete variables , and means and standard deviations or median and range for continuous variables .
Due to differences in the education systems in the United States and United Kingdom , we excluded women who were educated in the United Kingdom in our description of maternal education .
Further , we restricted our analyses of neurodevelopmental outcomes to cases who were ≥ 5 years of age at recruitment , since neurodevelopmental deficits may be under - diagnosed in younger children .
In addition to assessing each of 13 parental - reported ( yes / no ) neurodevelopmental outcomes , we created a composite neurodevelopmental outcome variable , indicating a positive parental report for at least one of four conditions : developmental delay , learning disability , mental retardation , or autism spectrum disorder [13] .
We used the chi - square test ( or Fisher ’ s exact test when > 20 % of cells had an expected cell count < 5 ) to compare the distribution of categorical variables across types of CHDs .
For continuous variables , we used ANOVA or the Kruskal - Wallis test to compare the mean or median , respectively , across types of CHDs .
For ANOVA analyses , we used Levene ’ s test to check the assumption of homogeneity of variance .
If Levene ’ s test was significant ( p < 0.05 ) , we used Welch ’ s ANOVA .
Analyses of all variables , except neurodevelopmental outcomes , were repeated in the subset of cases who were ≤ 1 year of age at recruitment for the following reasons : 1 ) inaccurate recall of characteristics or events before or during pregnancy is of greater concern for cases ascertained at older ages than at younger ages ; and 2 ) the distribution of characteristics across types of CHDs may be influenced by survival .
Because of the heterogeneity within type of CHDs , analyses were also repeated to compare specific subtypes in the two largest types of CHDs - CTD and LVOT cases .
These analyses were restricted to include subtypes that included at least 200 cases .
For LVOT , cases with aortic stenosis were combined with cases with bicuspid aortic valve to create a subtype called ‘ aortic valve disease . ’
Because differences in the distribution of neurodevelopmental outcomes across types of CHDs may be influenced by factors other than the CHD diagnosis , we used logistic regression to control for potential confounders determined a priori from the literature [15] : maternal education , case race / ethnicity , sex , birth weight ( low [ < 2,500 g ] , normal [ 2,500 - 4,000 g ] , high [ > 4,000 g ] ) , and extracardiac malformations ( yes / no ) .
Further , as neurodevelopmental deficits may be under - diagnosed in younger cases , we also adjusted for case age at the time of recruitment .
Adjusted analyses were not conducted for the CTD and LVOT subtypes because of the relatively small numbers of cases with specific outcomes ( e.g. , double outlet right ventricle with autism spectrum , N = 4 ) .
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC ) .
P - values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
Participants were invited to fill in an online survey in Germany and in the United States .
Individual participants were chosen that met the requirements to form a comparable German and U.S . sample .
In the email that was sent to potential participants , we wrote : “ In connection with Heidelberg University , we [ names of authors ] are currently conducting an international study to investigate the career path motivations of women and men after completion of their PhD work ” .
The sample was recruited from five universities : For the German sample , we decided to include two high - ranking universities , one from former West Germany and one from former East Germany .
We based this decision on the 2010 edition of the Shanghai ranking ( http://www.arwu.org/ ) , which compares and ranks the top five hundred universities in the world , based on criteria like number and citation rates of publications and scientific awards .
For the U.S . sample , we selected one Ivy League university and two state universities ; all of which ranked very highly in the mentioned ranking system .
We used the software “ Soscisurvey ” ( www.soscisurvey.de ) , which offers all state of the art requirements for online based surveys .
Each recipient was addressed personally via e - mail and received an individual serial number for the questionnaire .
The aim of this procedure was twofold : first , it ensured that each participant could only fill in the questionnaire once .
Second , it was possible to remind those recipients who had not responded to the survey .
However , it was not possible to link the serial number to participant ’ s email addresses , therefore guaranteeing anonymity of responses .
The e - mail addresses of the potential participants were collected individually from the universities ’ home pages .
Early career researchers from various academic fields were identified and addressed .
A balanced number of men and women was equally attained .
In the personalized email , it was stated that participation was a vital part of an international comparison study to investigate the work situation of early career researchers in Europe and in the United States .
No incentives besides receiving the study ’ s findings after completion were offered to participants .
Two reminders were sent to those participants who did not fill in the questionnaire after ten and fourteen days , respectively .
This procedure revealed the following total sample sizes and response rates ( in parentheses ) : German university 1 : N = 79 ( 36 % ) , German university 2 : N = 156 ( 35 % ) , U.S . university 1 : N = 83 ( 18.5 % ) , U.S . university 2 : N = 103 ( 22 % ) , U.S . university 3 : N = 42 ( 20 % ) .
The mean duration of filling in the questionnaire was M = 14.75 ( SD = 4.4 ) minutes .
From the initial total sample size of N = 463 , we eliminated 13 participants who did not fill in any questionnaires ( including demographic information ) .
Fifty participants reported that they no longer worked in academia at the time of assessment and were also excluded ; one more participant was excluded due to a nonsensical response ( self - reported age older than 900 years ) .
The final sample comprised 95 women and 107 men representing the two German universities , and 96 women and 101 men from three U.S . universities .
The total sample size was N = 399 .
We also assessed the academic fields of the study participants ( by the question : “ In which discipline did you acquire your PhD ? ” ) .
We then classified these answers following the ISCED Fields of education and training 2013 [33] , and formed four categorizations ( arts and humanities ; social sciences + business and law ; natural sciences ; and other academic fields ) .
About 40 % of participants in both countries acquired their PhD in natural sciences ( 36 % in Germany , 42 % in the US ) , about a quarter of participants in social sciences / business / law ( Germany : 25 % , US : 25 % ) and arts and humanities ( Germany : 24 % , US : 20 % ) , respectively .
There was no statistically meaningful difference between the two countries regarding academic fields , χ 2 ( 3 ) = 1.97 , p = .579 , Cramer ’ s V = .07 .
A detailed description of the sample is shown in S1 Table .

The Ethics Commission of the Faculty of Behavioural and Cultural Studies at Heidelberg University considers studies conducted by students as part of their degree program as exempt from ethical approval and expects the supervisors ( in this case : Monika Sieverding , the first author ) of the students to control that the ethical guidelines are fulfilled .
Therefore , in their guidelines it is stated that students ’ studies are only reviewed in in well - reasoned exemptions .
The guidelines can be retrieved here ( unfortunately only in German ) : http://www.verkult.uni-heidelberg.de/Formulare/Ethikkommission-Fakultaet-VerKult-HD_Informationen-zum-Verfahrensablauf.pdf ) .
As the data collection for the study presented in this manuscript stems from the Master thesis of Thomas Stahl ( the last author ) , and the study did not include any features that could be ethically relevant , we did not ask the Ethics Commission for ethical approval .
The supervisor of the study ( Monika Sieverding ) confirms that the study was conducted in line with the ethical guidelines set out by the German Psychological Society ( DGPs : https://www.dgps.de/fileadmin/documents/Empfehlungen/berufsethische_richtlinien_dgps.pdf .
The study did not bear any obvious risk to the physical or psychological well - being of the participants involved .
All data were collected and treated anonymously .
Participants were informed about the goal of the study , the procedures , and participants ’ rights .
Participation was voluntary .
Subjects were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any point without repercussions .
Subjects were assured that their data would be treated anonymously and that their answers could not be linked to them .
Participants were also informed that they could always contact the PI at any time if they had questions about the study .
Participants were informed that they are invited to participate in the study if they wish to by clicking on the link in the email .
Informed consent was given by all participants .
All data was treated anonymously .
As the data were collected via Soscisurvey , there was no option to track individuals or see who they were .
The IP addresses were not recorded .
When clicking on the provided personalized link , informed consent was obtained .
It was also possible to stop the survey at any given point and continue with the survey at a later point .
A point of contact was also provided in case participants had questions .
Work hours .
For assessing actual work hours , participants were asked : “ Please think about your typical work week .
How many total hours do you work currently in an average work week ( regardless of where this work takes place ) ? ” .
Ideal work hours were assessed by asking : “ What would be the ideal working hours for you per week ? ” .
Both of these questions were adapted from the study of Lubinski and colleagues [34] .
Calling .
Calling was assessed with five items from the “ Pennsylvania Work Life Questionnaire ” [31] , ranging from “ not at all ” to “ a lot ” .
Specifically , we asked the following five questions : “ I enjoy talking about my work to others ” , “ My work is one of the most important things in my life ” , “ If I was financially secure , I would continue with my current line of work even if I was no longer paid ” , “ My work makes the world a better place ” , “ I would choose my current work life again if I had the opportunity ” .
The items were translated into German and then back - translated into English for verification by two bilingual persons .
Cronbach ’ s alpha in the U.S . sample was .80 and in the German sample .72 .
Higher values indicate seeing the job as a calling .
Mother - child ideology .
Mother - child ideology was assessed by the subscale “ mother and child ideology ” of the questionnaire “ prejudices against workforce participation of women ” [35] .
The four items “ A pre - school child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works ” , “ A mother is irreplaceable in the first year of a child ' s life ” , “ Women , who are especially strong in terms of their engagement in their professions , cannot be good mothers at the same time ” , “ Mothers of small children , who pursue their professions full - time , do so at the expense of their children ' s development ” were measured on a 5 - point Likert - scale ranging from “ strongly disagree ” to “ strongly agree ” .
The items were translated into English and then back - translated into German for verification by two bilingual persons .
Cronbach ’ s alpha in the U.S . sample was .76 and in the German sample .81 .
Higher values indicate more traditional mother - child attitudes .
Gender was coded with 0 ( male ) and 1 ( female ) .
Years since PhD was calculated from answers given to the question “ When did you finish your PhD ( thesis defense or viva voce , respectively ) ? ” .
Duration of PhD was assessed with the question “ In total , how long did it take you to finish your PhD ( in years ) ? ” and here it was possible to answer in decimals .
Parenthood was assessed with the question “ Do you have children ? ” ( yes ; coded as 1 / no ; coded as 0 ) .
Participants ’ country was coded as 0 ( Germany ) or 1 ( USA ) , respectively .
We also examined whether the effects remained unchanged even after controlling for further variables .
We note that in contrast to the covariates specified in the previous section , these variables were not chosen as independent variables in an a - priori fashion .
Results involving these variables should therefore be interpreted as exploratory .
The main reason for including these variables was to examine if the effects were robust when including additional independent variables .
Perceived career attractiveness was measured using one item ( “ How attractive do you consider an academic career for you personally ? ” ) with responses ranging from 1 “ very unattractive ” to 5 “ very attractive ” .
Distribution of work time was assessed as the percentage of work time devoted to research , teaching , and administration , respectively ( with the constraint that percentages needed to amount to 100 % ) .
Further , we assessed whether the participants ’ current position was permanent ( coded as 1 ) or not ( coded as 0 ) .
Results involving these variables will be presented at the end of the Results section .
Descriptive statistics for the sample data are presented in the Supplementary S1 and S2 Tables .
Three hundred and forty - seven participants ( 87 % of the sample ) had complete data on all study variables .
Missing values were replaced using multiple imputation implemented via the mice package [36] in R .
Thirty imputations were computed and the pooled results across the imputed data sets are reported .
Note that this resulted in non - integer values for degrees of freedom .

Experiments were performed with aerobically grown yeast cells from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis ( ATCC 9080 ; American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA , USA ) cultivated aerobically in a rotary shaker ( 180 rpm ) in liquid semisynthetic minimal medium [22] at 28 ° C .
The cells were grown until the glucose in the medium was just exhausted at the transition from the logarithmic to the stationary growth phase .
After harvesting the cells by centrifugation at 5000g at 21 ° C and washing them with distilled water , the wet cells were suspended in 0.1 M KH2PO 4 buffer , pH 6.5 , as a 20 % ( weight / volume ) suspension and stirred at 23 ° C until they showed NADH oscillations .
This generally occurred after 3 - 5 h of starvation .
After starvation the cells were aliquoted in 1.5 ml Eppendorf cups and kept at 0 ° C for at most 3 days until use .
Prior to measuring signals of cell populations , the aliquoted cells were diluted in 0.1 M KH2PO 4 buffer , pH 6.5 to densities in the range of = 0.8 - 0.001 % ( w / v ) ( i.e. 120106 - 0.1106 cells / ml ) and well aerated by stirring the suspension for at least 5 min .
Some experiments were conducted using cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae diploid strain X2180 .
The cells were grown under aerobic conditions at 30 ° C in a rotary shaker ( 150 rpm ) in a medium containing 10.0 g / l glucose , 6.7 g / l yeast nitrogen base ( Bacto ) and 100 mM potassium phthalate ( Aldrich ) at pH 5.0 until the glucose in the medium was exhausted .
The yeast was harvested by centrifugation at 4066g for 3 min at 21 ° C , washed twice with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( Merck , Germany ) , pH 6.8 ( centrifugation , 3 min at 4066g ) and re - suspended in the same buffer to a cell density of 10 % ( w / v ) .
The cells were starved in suspension by shaking ( 30 ° C , 150 rpm ) for 3 h and handled then as S . carlsbergensis , but with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 6.8 ) .
Immobilisation of yeast cells in the batch chamber : Single yeast cells were immobilised on polylysine - coated coverslips .
To this purpose , the coverslips were washed with acetone and distilled water .
Subsequently , 100l of a 0.1 mg / l poly - D - lysine solution were spread on the coverslips , which were then dried in an oven at 50 ° C .
Before use , they were carefully washed with water again and dried .
Finally , a dry coverslip was fixed at the bottom of the batch chamber mounted above the objective of the inverted microscope .
The batch chamber consists of two parts between which the coated coverslip is clamped .
100l well - aerated yeast suspension of a chosen cell density were placed into the chamber ( consequently , the number of cells in the chamber varied according to the cell densities studied ) .
After 30 min all cells settled and adhered to the coverslip when their plasma membranes got in contact with the polylysine coating .
After sedimentation the experiment was started .
To induce anaerobiosis 3 mM potassium cyanide were added , followed by an addition of 52 mM glucose 10 min later , which triggered the glycolysis and induced oscillations in the cells .
The intracellular dynamics was monitored through the autofluorescence of NADH which serves as an indicator for the glycolytic activity [22] .
NADH is an intracellular metabolite which is directly involved in the glycolysis .
The NADH autofluorescence ( absorption maximum at = 340 nm ; emission maximum at = 460 nm [42] ) from single yeast cells was measured with an inverted Nikon Ti Eclipse ( Nikon GmbH , Germany ) microscope , equipped with a 100 / 0.5 - 1.3 plan fluor lens and a position sensitive single photon counting photomultiplier tube as described previously [43] .
For excitation of intracellular NADH a 8 MHz pulsed frequency - tripled Nd : vanadate laser tuned at 355 nm ( HighQ Laser , Austria ) was used .
A dichroic mirror ( z355r dc , AHF Analysentechnik , Germany ) discriminated between excitation and emission .
The emission light of yeast cells was filtered by a long - pass ( LP 442 nm , Brightline , AHF , Germany ) and a bandpass filter ( FF 01 - 440 / 40 , Brightline , AHF , Germany ) and detected by the photomultiplier .
For all studied samples , the laser intensity was adjusted such that there was an incidence of 3,000 - 65,000 fluorescence photons / s at the detector , thus making sure that it operates under optimal conditions .
The acquired photon positions were binned into frames of 512512 pixels , resulting in a resolution of 0.33m / pixel in the object space .
The field of view had a diameter of 169m .
The photon flux was integrated over 2 s time intervals , which was a sufficient sampling rate to analyse glycolytic oscillations with periods in a range of 24 - 70 s .
The global , collective signal of the whole population of yeast cells and the signal from individual cells were analysed separately .
The immobilised yeast cells were randomly distributed on the coverslip .
The collective signal was determined as the fluorescence light emitted from all cells in the entire area of observation .
Therefore , all incident photons were summed up every second .
For the analysis of single cell signals , the position of each cell in the population was determined and its area , in pixels , marked .
At any time , the single cell fluorescence is the mean value of the intensity of the fluorescence signal detected in the area occupied by an individual cell ( 1 ) where is the number of incident photons originating from the area of the single cell .
The temporal sequence of yields the time evolution of the fluorescence of an individual cell .
For comparison , the amplitudes of the metabolic oscillations of the individual cells were normalised .
Here , the norm was set by the oscillating amplitude of the cell in the population that showed the highest oscillatory amplitudes .
Analysis of synchronicity within populations : From the time series of each cell in a population , we subtracted the baseline to eliminate spurious drifts and trends .
The baseline was computed as the walking average of the fluorescence data using a time window corresponding to one period of oscillation .
After baseline subtraction , we obtained oscillations around zero and determined their frequencies by a fast Fourier transform .
The standard deviation of the periods of oscillation of single cells was calculated as ( 2 ) where is the oscillation period of the th cell , is the averaged period , and is the number of cells .
The noise in the time - series was filtered through a Fourier bandpass filter which cut off frequencies higher than 0.05 Hz and lower than 0.014 Hz .
Thus , the frequencies of the glycolytic oscillations remained in the filtered time series .
The phases of each oscillating cell ( 3 ) were computed trough the Hilbert transform ( 4 ) of the filtered single cell signal .
The order parameter K , introduced by Shinomoto and Kuramoto [38] , ( 5 ) and the time - averaged order parameter ( 6 ) were chosen for measuring the phase synchronisation .
If the order parameter is close to 1 the coherence of oscillators in a population is high and if is 0 the cells oscillate at random phases .
The standard deviation of ( eq . 5 ) and the mean value are used to quantify the phase synchronisation in each measurement .

The stock solution ( 5.56 mg / mL ) was prepared by dissolving an appropriate amount of LA in 200 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 5.29 ) .
The calibration curve was made using seven standard solutions of different concentrations ( 5.00 , 4.00 , 3.00 , 2.00 , 1.00 , 0.500 , 0.100 mg / mL ) .
The standard solutions were prepared by diluting an appropriate volume of stock solution with the phosphate buffer and D2O ( containing TSP as the internal standard for chemical shift calibration and quantitative analysis ) was added to volume percentage of 10 % for each sample .
Each solution was analyzed twice .
The peak area values were plotted against the corresponding analyte concentrations to obtain the linear calibration .
Intraday precision of the method was determined by measuring six sample of LA ( 2.00 mg / mL ) on the same day .
Twelve or more test tubes were laid in a thermostat bath at predefined temperature and were periodically withdrawn during a kinetic run .
Withdrawn samples were rapidly cooled in ice to quench the reaction and were stored in an ice bath until analysis within 2 h .
Each study was comprised of twelve or more assays spaced to provide change of ~ 0.1 C10 per samples .
After NMR analysis , degradation samples were diluted with an equal volume of 0.3 M phosphoric acid .
2 μ L diluted samples were injected into LC - MSn system for tentative structure elucidation of the degradation products .
The influences of temperature and pH values on degradation of LA were investigated .
The influence of temperature on degradation was investigated in phosphate buffer solutions at a pH value of 4.75 .
The reaction rate constants were calculated at 80 , 91 and 100 ° C , respectively .
The effect of pH values on degradation was determined at 91 ° C in phosphate buffer solutions .
Specific experimental conditions were listed in Table 2 .
All the pH measurements were performed on a pH meter ( S40 SevenMulti , Mettler - Toledo GmbH , Greifensee , Switzerland ) equipped with combination pH electrode ( InLab Expert Pro ) .

According to the results of preliminary experiment , supposing the degradation of LA followed irreversible first - order reaction kinetics , ordinary differential equation of LA concentration was obtained as follows : formtok where C1 is the concentration of LA and kr 1 is the of LA .
Therefore , the concentration of LA could be described by Eqs ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) formtok formtok where C10 is the initial concentration of LA .
For Sal A , it was degraded from LA and would transform to Sal C and other isomers .
Assuming all these reactions follow irreversible first - order reaction kinetics , ordinary differential equation of Sal A was obtained as follows : formtok where C2 is the concentration of Sal A , kr 2 is the rate constant of LA transform to Sal A , kr 3 is the rate constant of Sal A transform to other compounds .
Because the initial concentration of Sal A was 0 , Eq ( 5 ) can be derived from Eqs ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) : formtok
The influence of temperature on reaction rate constant was given by Arrhenius equation : ln kr = ln A − EaRT ( 6 ) where A represents frequency factor , Ea stands for activation energy , R is ideal gas constant ( 8.314 J / mol · K ) and T is temperature ( K ) .
All data fitting were carried out using OriginLab ( Pro 8 , OriginLab Corp . , Northampton , MA ) .
Accelerometer data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed to address the study objective .
The original monitoring protocol was approved by each participating university ' s ethics committee ( University of Arkansas ; University of California ; University of Kansas ; University of New Hampshire / Wellesley ; Pennsylvania State University / University of Pittsburgh ; Temple University ; University of Virginia ; University of Washington ; Western Carolina Center ; and University of Wisconsin ) and written consent was obtained from each participant .
Details regarding the enrollment procedure and research protocol are available from the study ' s website ( http://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/supported/seccyd/pages/overview.aspx ) .
Accelerometer data were collected across a 7 - day monitoring period using 1 - minute epochs at mean ages of 9 , 11 , 12 , and 15 yrs .
ActiLife software ( version 6.4.3 ) was used to detect and remove daily non - wear intervals between the hours of 7 : 00 and 22 : 00 .
Similar to other studies [3] , non - wear periods included intervals of at least 60 consecutive minutes of zero activity counts , allowing for 2 minutes of counts between 0 and 100 .
Epochs exceeding 20,000 counts / min were reset to zero .
Daily wear time was determined by removing daily non - wear periods .
At each mean age , four separate data sets were created using minimum daily time requirements of 6 , 8 , 10 , and 12 hrs .
Accelerometer data were then interpreted in a manner consistent with the approach used in the International Children Accelerometer Database [10] , where the amount of MVPA ( mins / day ) was determined using a threshold of 3000 counts / min .
A total of 1082 youth were enrolled in the accelerometer protocol at 9 yrs .
Age - related trends in activity have been previously reported with these data [13] ; however , the objective of the current study was not addressed .
Descriptive analyses were conducted for accelerometer wear time and MVPA by age and wear time criteria .
Missing value analyses were conducted to report the proportion of missing data by day of the week and Little ' s chi - square statistic was used to report the mechanism of missingness .
The null hypothesis for Little ' s chi - square test states that the data are MCAR ; therefore , p - values < 0.05 were considered significant and under this circumstance the missing data would be MAR or NMAR .
Several reviews of MAR , MCAR , and NMAR exist [14] , [15] , but a brief interpretation is provided .
Missing data are likely to be MAR [16] , and under this mechanism the pattern of missingness is systematically related to some observed characteristic .
In this situation , it is assumed that the actual variables where data are missing are not the cause of the incomplete data .
MCAR is a sub - category of MAR [17] , but comparatively more stringent , and assumes that missing data are unrelated to the variables being studied .
In this context , individuals with missing data represent a simple random sample of the full sample ( i.e. , individuals with complete data are indistinguishable from those with incomplete data ) .
Under the third mechanism ( NMAR ) , the pattern of missing data is related to unobserved characteristic ( s ) .
Of the three missing data mechanisms , only MCAR can be empirically tested because MAR and NMAR are dependent upon unobserved data .
Descriptive and missing value analyses were conducted using SPSS v 20 .
To address the study ' s primary objective , reliability coefficients using complete ( nd = 7 ) and observable ( 1 ≤ nd ≤ 7 ) accelerometer data were compared using G theory methods .
Although G theory has been described in the literature [18] , [19] , few studies have applied this approach to PA research [12] , [20] - [24] .
Following the framework outlined by Brennan [18] , the current study employed a single facet ( participant × day ) design with missing data , where variance component estimates were derived using analogous T terms for the object of measurement ( participants ( o2p ) ) , the facet ( day ( o2d ) ) , and the interaction term which is confounded with unsystematic or unmeasured error ( o2 pd ) .
Derived variance components were then used to calculate two types of error ( absolute ( o2 Δ ) and relative ( o2 δ ) ) .
Absolute , or criterion - referenced , error is the error involved in using a participant ' s mean score as an estimate of their universe score ( i.e. , o2 Δ = ( o2 d / d ) + ( o2 pd / d ) ) , whereby d is the harmonic mean of ( i.e. , the number of days with acceptable data from each participant ) [18] and is derived using Equation 1 . ( Equation ) In contrast , relative error is associated with norm - referenced interpretations of measurement and equals the variance of the observed mean score for participants ( S2 p ) minus participant variance ( o2 δ = S2 p - o2 p ) ( Equation 2 ) . ( Equation ) A complex issue arises in the calculation of S2 p because the mean score for each participant is based on a different number of acceptable days , ranging from 1 to 7 .
Variance components obtained from the unbalanced design were used in the D study to derive a reliability coefficient that characterized complete data ( nd = 7 ) ( Ep2Complete = o2 p / [ o2 p + ( o2 pd / nd ) ] ) and , specific to this study , a separate coefficient that characterized all observable data ( 1 ≤ nd ≤ 7 ) ( Ep2Observed = o2 p / S2 p ) .
Coefficients range from 0 to 1 .
In PA research , reliability coefficients ≥ 0.80 are desirable .
Standard error of the mean ( SEM ) , which provides an indication of the uncertainty associated with each measure , was calculated for each condition by taking the square root of the absolute error term .
The SEM is expressed in the same metric unit of measurement and represents a 68 % CI for the participant ' s universe score .
Variance components , error estimates , and reliability coefficients were derived using EXCEL macros created by the corresponding author ( see Tables S1 and S2 for a detailed description of the G theory calculations ) .
The fMRI study included eight right - handed healthy volunteers ( 5 males , 3 females , mean age 26.2 years , range 20 - 34 years ) , who were either students or physicians and already experienced in participating in psychophysical studies .
All participants participated voluntarily in the experiments and none of them were taking medication that might have interfered with the induction of subacute muscle soreness or with pain sensations ( i.e. analgesics , anesthetics or other centrally acting drugs ) .
The study adhered to the claims of the Declaration of Helsinki and the protocol was approved by the local ethics committee ( Institutional Review Board of the University Erlangen - Nuremberg ) .
Induction of delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) : DOMS is a physiological pain state that occurs following a bout of eccentric muscle contractions and peaks in intensity 24 - 48 hours after exercise [18] .
To induce DOMS in the quadriceps muscle group , subjects performed 120 - 150 up - down step cycles with their right leg .
A step cycle consisted of stepping up onto a small platform with the right leg ( concentric quadriceps contraction ) then stepping back down with the left leg which forces the right leg to bear the body weight ( eccentric quadriceps contraction ) .
The height of the platform was adjusted such that the included knee angle was 90 ° or less when the right foot was placed on the platform , i.e. the eccentric contraction was performed over a long quadriceps muscle length .
36 to 48 hours later , subjects were psychophysically evaluated .
Eight of the eleven subjects experienced intense soreness and long lasting pain in their quadriceps muscle upon contraction or physical stimulation and were admitted to the fMRI experiment .
None of the subjects reported resting pain .
Experimental pain model and intensity rating : The intensity of the pain was quantified and monitored using the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ranging from 0 to 100 % as previously described [19] .
The rating scale was fed back to the subject as a light bar representing the levels 0 - 100 % of the common VAS scale , whereby “ 0 % ” signifies no pain , “ 100 % ” marks maximal imaginable pain .
For psychophysical measurements , the subjects sat reclined in a dental chair and the paradigm was carried out as later in the fMRI sessions , with the only difference that subjects were asked to operate the VAS with a turning knob to rate the pain as perceived during the contractions and during stimulation with the heavy marble roll .
As for the contraction task , the subjects were instructed to perform a maximal isometric contraction of their painful and non - painful quadriceps muscle , but also to refrain from movements of the head as much as possible .
Only those subjects who judged the contraction / stimulation with the roll on the sore side as painful , and attributed a rating of at least 15 % on average were admitted to the fMRI experiment .
The success rate ( of achieving painful DOMS with this training method ) exceeded 70 % , i.e. eight of the eleven subjects that were initially trained by eccentric exercise , had developed painful soreness and were admitted to the scanner to record their brain activation in response to stimulation of the painful muscles .
For control purposes , the subjects were asked after the fMRI experiment , to estimate the intensity of pain they had experienced during both self - controlled contraction and physical stimulation .
In all subjects the pain ratings confirmed the ratings that were obtained during the psychophysical training session prior to the fMRI measurement .
Shortly before subjects attended the fMRI scanner they were instructed to refrain from movement as much as possible .
In the scanner the subjects ' head was immobilized by fixing the head binaurally with a thrust device .
A mirror was mounted above the eyes to allow the subject to see the light indicating the protocol , which was positioned outside the scanner .
Two paradigms were used to evoke DOMS - associated muscle pain in the fMRI environment .
The first paradigm involved alternate repeated active contractions of the right ( sore ) and the left ( sound ) quadriceps muscle group and was phasic in nature .
The stimulus is identical to an isometric contraction and the evoked pain proves to be suited for the requirements of a functional MRI stimulus design that calls for stimuli with fast on - and offset .
The whole paradigm consisted of 5 cycles of alternating non - painful ( control condition ) and painful contractions ( stimulus ) with eleven interleaved resting conditions ( baselines ) , respectively 24 and 18 seconds ( Fig . 1 ) .
A red light indicated the stimulation period , during which the subjects were asked to repeatedly contract their right ( sore ) quadriceps muscle .
Indicating control condition , the light switched to green , and the subjects to their healthy , left quadriceps group , maintaining phasic contractions over the period of the non - painful stimulus ( control condition ) .
In detail , for the contraction - related task , the subjects were advised to contract their quadriceps muscle either with maximum strength or until maximal tolerable pain was perceived and then to relax and contract the muscle again .
One cycle of contraction and subsequent relaxation resulted in approximately 3 seconds and was repeated during the 24 seconds of stimulation until the light switched off to indicate baseline condition .
The second paradigm consisted in physical stimulation of the sore areas of the thigh by externally applied localized pressure .
It was used to separate brain activation in response to deep muscle pain from activation resulting from muscle contraction .
Due to the slow adaptation properties of sensitized nociceptors ( in deep tissues ) , pain sensation in response to tonic locally applied pressure dampens within seconds [20] , [21] .
In order to obtain a persistent and constant pain sensation during the 24 seconds of stimulation , the pressure was moved constantly within the sore target area of the quadriceps .
This was achieved by using a custom - designed marble roll .
The marble roll was fixed in a brass handle and did not interfere with the signal of the scanner ( Fig . 1a ) .
During the 24 s of stimulation , the experimenter gently rolled the device back and forth over the sore ( or contralateral control ) target areas .
This procedure is referred to as “ physical stimulation ” .
To evoke comparable pain rating and achieve constant stimulation conditions across the group of subjects , the most painful areas of the thigh were marked with tape in each subject prior to the fMRI measurement ( tape was placed and stimulation performed through the trousers in order to prevent activation of brain areas due to stimulation of cutaneous cold receptors by the marble roll ) .
Accordingly , the marble roll was held perpendicularly to the surface and rolled only over the marked areas .
Furthermore , care was taken to exert pressure only by imposing the 1.75 kg dead load of the roll and no additional force .
This way of stimulation produced in all subjects a deep and constant painful feeling with fast on - and offset .
Few hours before accessing the fMRI scanner , each subject underwent a training session in order to make the subjects familiar with the stimulation procedure , but also to evaluate intensity and time course of the pain and to find and mark the most painful areas of the thigh with tape .

Muscle pain was evoked in a muscle group suffering DOMS during an fMRI measurement by two paradigms : voluntary contraction of the painful muscle ( paradigm 1 ) and painful physical stimulation of the sore muscles with a 1.75 kg heavy marble rolling pin ( paradigm 2 ) .

The scanning procedure included 5 repetitions of the same stimulus combination ( 5x EPI ) .
A Scout epoque - used to determine the position of the subject ' s head within the scanner - is followed by the acquisition of the high - resolution anatomical MPRAGE data set .
A short EPI sequence is required to accustom the subject to the unfamiliar noise of the following EPI scans .
The numbers in the block design ( x - axis ) are equivalent to scanning frames and one frame corresponds to 3 s acquisition time .
The conditions were as follows : 1 : resting condition ( baseline ) ; 2 : contralateral painless quadriceps contraction or painless physical stimulation ; 3 : ipsilateral painful quadriceps contraction or painful physical stimulation .
Image acquisition , study design and MRI sequence order : Images were collected with a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner ( Magnetom Sonata , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) using a standard quadrature head coil .
Preceding the functional measurements , a high resolution data set of each subject ’ s brain was acquired using a T1 - weighted , 3D gradient - echo pulse sequence ( MPRAGE : magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo ; voxel size = 1 , 0 mm 3 ; TR / TE = 1950 ms / 4.38 ms , FOV = 256 mm , 256 × 256 matrix , 160 slices , FOV = 256 mm , slice thickness = 1 mm ) .
Functional scans were acquired using a blood - oxygen - level - dependent ( BOLD ) protocol with a T2 - weighted gradient echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence ( TR / TE / θ = 3000 ms / 60 ms / 90 ° ; slice thickness = 4 mm ; interslice interval = 1 mm , FOV = 220 mm , 64 × 64 matrix ) .
20 axial slices were placed such that the best possible whole brain coverage was obtained , usually from the top of the cortex to the base of the cerebellum .
The first three images were discarded to account for spin saturation effects thus eliminating non - equilibrium effects of the magnetization .
MRI sequences were measured in the following order : anatomical scout , MPRAGE , and two EPI sequences .
The first EPI was short and applied to accustom the subject to the noise .
The second EPI consisted of 150 whole brain acquisitions divided into 5 cycles and entailing the protocol as described above .
Eight sequences were acquired during the stimulus period time ( 24 s ) and six during the interposed baseline periods ( resting condition , 18 s ; see Fig .1 ) .
Data processing and statistical analysis : Imaging data analysis , registration , visualisation and statistical analyses were performed with the BrainVoyager QX software package ( Brain Innovation B.V . , Maastricht ; The Netherlands ) .
Pre - processing of the data was performed as previously described [22] and included three - dimensional motion correction , temporal Gaussian smoothing of 4 s , spatial Gaussian smoothing of 4 mm , linear detrending and temporal high pass filtering using 0.01 Hz .
The 3D - MPRAGE data set was transformed into the standard stereotactic space [23] and the T2 weighted images were realigned to this high - resolution 3D - data set [24] thus enabling a 3D - reconstruction of the activation maps .
Fixed - effect analyses were performed and to search for clusters of activation , we used a block design with two conditions ( stimulus vs . control ) and an interposed baseline ( see Fig .1b ) .
The stimulus sequence pattern was convoluted with a hemodynamic response function to account for the expected delay and devolution of the BOLD signal [25] , [26] and served as a basis for the calculation of the correlation coefficients of the respective cluster .
Blocks of contraction activity within the stimulation pattern served as independent predictors for a general linear model ( GLM ) .
Activation was detected by correlating the time course of the BOLD - signal of each voxel with the predictor pattern of the GLM .
Contrasts of interest were calculated by subtraction analysis and t - tests were calculated as differential responses , resulting in statistical maps ( painful vs . non - painful states [ contraction - / physical stimulation - induced muscle pain vs . contralateral control ] ) .
P - values < 5 * 10 − 6 ( uncorrected ) are marked in Table 1 .
The subtraction analyses were complemented with separate evaluation of the activation pattern of each stimulus versus its control .
Analyses were performed at the group level ( multi - study ) .
Location of activated clusters was verified using a printed atlas [27] and labelled using Tailarach ' s nomenclature [23] by means of the Tailarach Daemon ( Research Imaging Center , University of Texas Health Center , San Antonio , TX , USA ) .
Table 1 lists clusters with a minimum number of 250 voxels corresponding to 250 mm 3 .
We focussed on clusters located in the following brain areas : frontal and parietal lobe , insula , cingulum , thalamus , basal ganglia and the cerebellum .
Processing of the clusters included identification of Brodman ' s Area ( BA ; or closest BA in case the centre of the cluster was located in the white matter ) , determination of spatial centre ( coordinates ) , and their statistical significance ( t - value ) .
Psychophysical data were recorded with custom made software .

The protocol of this study was approved by the Ethics Committee in Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning , Beijing Normal University .
Subjects were informed with written consent .
This study was compatible with Code of Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects of the World Medical Association ( Declaration of Helsinki ) .
Twenty - two healthy volunteers ( postgraduate students ) were recruited ( 12 female and 10 male , 20 - 30 years old ) from the Kunming Institute of Zoology , CAS .
Subjects had normal or corrected - to - normal vision .
All subjects were paid Y20 .
All Subjects were initially naive to experiment , but received training to familiarize them with the task procedure before beginning the experimental task .
No subjects had any history of mental disorder .
An EyeLink 2000 Desktop eye tracking system ( SR Research Ltd . , Ontario , Canada ) was used to present stimuli and record eye movements .
Monocular eye position data was sampled at 2000 Hz .
Stimuli were displayed on a 19 inch LCD monitor ( DELL E198F Pf , 37.5 × 30.5 cm , resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels , refresh rate of 60 Hz ) .
The eye - to - screen distance and the eye - to - camera distance were 70 cm and 50 cm , respectively .
Thus , to the subjects , the screen occupied approximately 30 ° × 25 ° of visual angle , horizontally and vertically , respectively .
Subjects ' heads were immobilized by a chin - rest .
Saccades were detected by three thresholds : a velocity threshold of 30 o / s , an initial acceleration threshold of 8000 o / s2 and a displacement threshold of 0.15 ° .
Fixation was defined as the time between two saccades .
Because gender differences were observed in responses to visual emotional stimuli [71] , [72] , two equivalent affective picture packages for male and female subjects were selected from the International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) [26] .
Valence was rated on a scale from 1 ( most unpleasant ) to 9 ( most pleasant ) ; arousal was rated in scale from 1 ( sleepy , not at all arousing ) to 9 ( most exciting ) .
Each subject had to finish two blocks ( 60 pictures ) : the valences block ( AB , 30 pictures ) with 10 pleasant ( HV ) , 10 neutral ( MV ) and 10 unpleasant ( LV ) pictures categorized by valence score ; and the arousal block ( 30 pictures ) : 10 exciting ( HA ) , 10 calm ( MA ) and 10 sleepy ( LA ) pictures categorized by arousal score .
Pictures were complex , color scenes involving animals , people , blood , mutilation , nature scenes , etc .
Arousal ratings for valence block pictures were at the medium level ( M = 5.1 , SD = 0.29 ) , and valence ratings for arousal block pictures were at the neutral level ( M = 5.21 , SD = 0.69 ) .
The Pictures ' IAPS series numbers are listed in Table S3 .
Low - level Image Properties & Familiarity : The feature - based factors of picture complexity and luminance showed no significant differences in the valence block ( p = 0.24 and p = 0.18 , respectively ) or the arousal block ( p = 0.67 and p = 0.81 , respectively ) , Kruskal - Wallis test .
Picture complexity was measured as the compressed image file size in kB [26] .
Larger file sizes indicated more complex images .
Picture luminance was calculated with Adobe Photoshop CS 2 ( Adobe Systems Inc . , USA ) in 0 - 255 gray scale .
The spatial frequencies of images in the two blocks showed no marked differences ( Text S1 ) .
Familiarity was rated on a 7 - point scale ( 1 = least familiar , 7 = most familiar ) by subjects during the task .
Differences in the familiarity ratings were significant within the valence block ( p < 0.01 ) and as well as within the arousal block ( p < 0.01 ) , but were not significant between the two blocks ( Kruskal - Wallis tests ) .
Participants sat in a quiet dark house , with their head placed on chin - rest in front of the stimulus presentation screen .
Before picture display began , the ‘ 9 - point calibration ’ program of the eye - tracking system was run to ensure that the EyeLink camera could capture the subject ' s pupil .
Each subject had to finish two blocks ( 60 trials ) , beginning with the valence block ( VB , 30 trails ) and followed by the arousal block ( AB , 30 trails ) .
Subjects were allowed a rest interval between blocks , the duration of which was left to their discretion .
At the onset of a trail , a Gaussian - noise image was displayed on screen for two seconds , during this period the subject was asked to fixate on a black center cross .
Then a target affective picture ( randomly presented without repetition ) was displayed for five seconds .
Subjects were asked to view the picture freely and the left eye was monitored during this period .
Next , a patch image ( any part of the affective picture , 250 × 200 pixels , selected randomly from 30 patches ) was presented in the screen center [73] .
Subjects were asked to press the key ‘ 0 ’ if they thought this patch was part of the target picture , or press the key ‘ 1 ’ otherwise .
Subjects were instructed to respond as quickly as possible .
Audio feedback was given ( a ‘ doo ’ sound for incorrect responses and a ‘ dee ’ sound for correct responses ) .
This patch - task encouraged subjects to freely view the picture because the patch image was randomly clipped out of the target picture and it was too small to be easily recognized if subject had just fixated at one place .
The familiarity rating task followed this ; subjects were asked to hit a number key as soon as possible to rate the target picture on a 7 point scale of familiarity ( 1 = totally unacquainted , 7 = completely familiar ) .
A ‘ 9 - point calibration ’ program was performed every ten trials in each block .
The duration of the entire experiment was approximately 40 minutes .
Path graph modeling and computation of topological metrics were performed on the MATLAB ( Mathworks Inc . , MA , USA ) software platform .
Curve fitting of spectral embedding path graphs employed the Curve Fitting Toolbox in MATLAB .
Scan paths with fewer than five fixations could not be fitted by our model , hence these data were discarded .
Statistical comparisons employed Welch ' s t - test , ANOVA and Tukey ' s post hoc test .
Rating scores were analyzed with nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis tests .
Trend analysis on graded affective effects was performed by F - test .
Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health ( J - ECOH ) Study is an ongoing , large - scale study among workers in Japan .
According to standard procedure of the study , researchers obtained several types of worker health data including those of periodic health checkup ( 2008 and thereafter ) , cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction and stroke ) , death from all causes , and long - term sick leave ( 1 month or longer ) from participating companies .
Additional researches including case - control study on cardiovascular event and nutritional survey were performed in selected companies .
In Japan , employees are obliged to undergo general health examination at least once a year under the health and safety law .
Of the 11 participating companies of the J - ECOH Study , 9 provided data on periodic health checkup that was performed during the period between 2008 and 2011 , which was then combined to create an analytic database .
Of these , data with the earliest date of examination ( mostly in 2008 ) were selected for the present cross - sectional analysis ; however , if 2008 dataset for a company contained a much greater number of missing information or much fewer subjects than other datasets , 2009 or 2010 dataset were used instead , giving a total sample size of 80,469 ( 67,472 men and 12,997 women aged 15 - 84 years ) for cross - sectional analysis .
Prior to the collection of data , the conduct of the J - ECOH Study was announced in each company by using posters that explained the purpose and procedure of the study .
Participants did not provide their verbal or written informed consent to join the study but were allowed to refuse their participation .
This procedure conforms to the Japanese Ethical Guidelines for Epidemiological Research [19] , where informed consent is not necessarily required for observational studies using existing data .
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine , Japan .
Most participating companies provided data in either anonymized or de - identified form , but a few other companies provided data including identifiable information , which was removed from analytic database .
The data are hosted in the National Center for Global Health and Medicine .
Currently , the data cannot be widely shared because the research group has not obtained permission from participating companies to provide the data on request .
However , the data can be requested by other researchers for the purpose of academic , non - commercial research ; inquiries and applications can be made to Department of Epidemiology and Prevention , Center for Clinical Sciences , National Center for Global Health and Medicine , Tokyo , Japan .
We extracted checkup data for 64,434 individuals in 4 companies where overtime work data were available from the original database .
Of these , we excluded data for 1,809 participants who reported a history of cardiovascular disease ( n = 490 ) , cerebrovascular disease ( n = 182 ) , or psychiatric disease ( n = 1,160 ) .
After this manipulation , we further excluded 21,764 subjects who had missing data on overtime work ( n = 7,604 ) , HbA1c ( n = 12,768 ) , blood glucose ( n = 11,871 ) , current use of anti - diabetic drug ( n = 1,261 ) , body mass index ( BMI ) ( n = 138 ) , smoking status ( n = 6,032 ) , and fasting condition ( n = 1,449 ) ; and who received health checkup in non - fasting condition ( n = 4,592 ) .
Some participants met more than one of the exclusion criteria .
Finally , 40,861 participants ( 35,170 men and 5,691 women ) remained for analysis .
Body height and body weight were measured according to a standard protocol in each company .
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters .
History of disease and health - related lifestyle were ascertained using a questionnaire , the content of which differs considerably among participating companies .
Biochemical measurements included plasma glucose and HbA1c .
HbA1c was measured according to a method used by the Japan Diabetes Society , thus we converted it to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program ( NGSP ) equivalent value ( % ) using the formula : HbA1c ( % ) = 1.02 × HbA1c ( Japan Diabetes Society ) ( % ) + 0.25 % [20] .
In two companies , employees self - reported overtime work hours at health checkup ( < 45 , 45 to < 60 , 60 to < 80 , 80 to < 100 , or ≥ 100 hours per month in the last 2 to 3 months ; < 45 , 45 to < 80 , 80 to < 100 , or ≥ 100 hours per month , respectively ) .
In another company , employees self - reported average total working hours per day at the timing of health checkup and monthly overtime were calculated using the following formula : ( daily hours worked - 8 h ) × 20 days .
In the remaining company , employees were asked to self - report their overtime work hours in the last month with 11 response options ( from “ 0 to 10 ” to “ > 100 hours ” per month ) at annual survey , not health checkup , in September .
We classified these data on overtime work hours into 4 categories using cutoff point of 45 , 80 , and 100 hours per month for statistical analysis .
In one company , 41 - 50 hours and 71 - 80 hours of overtime was categorized into 45 - 79 hours , and > 100 hours into ≥ 100 hours for statistical analysis .
Diabetes was diagnosed according to the American Diabetes Association criteria [21] as a fasting plasma glucose level of ≥ 126 mg / dl ( ≥ 7.0 mmol / L ) , HbA1c of ≥ 6.5 % ( ≥ 48 mmol / mol ) , or the current use of anti - diabetic drug .
Smoking status ( never , past , or current ) and , if current smoker , number of cigarettes smoked per day were asked at the time of health check - up .
Detailed information on job , lifestyle , and family history of disease was available in one of these companies and used for adjustment as a sensitivity analysis .
The information on shift work , job position , type of department , alcohol consumption , sleep duration , physical activity , and family history of diabetes was assessed using a questionnaire at the time of health check - up .
Shift work was categorized as shift worker ( rotating or night shift ) or non - shift worker .
Job position was categorized as high position ( department chief , department director , or more ) or low position ( others ) .
We classified 12 departments into two categories ; one was termed “ field work ” for 4 departments and the rest was termed “ non - field work ” for 8 departments .
Averaged daily ethanol consumption from alcohol beverage was calculated as drinking frequency multiplied by ethanol consumption per drinking day .
Average sleep duration were assessed with 4 options ( < 5 hours , 5 - < 6 hours , 6 - < 7 hours , or ≥ 7 hours ) .
Total weekly minutes of leisure time physical activity were calculated as frequency of physical activity or sports activity multiplied by duration of the activity .
The difference of age , sex , smoking , and BMI between those who were included in the present analysis and those who were excluded was tested by using t - test for continuous variables and χ 2 test for categorical variables .
Means ( standard error ) and percentages across overtime category were presented for continuous and categorical variables with adjustment for age and sex , respectively .
Trend association was assessed using linear regression analysis for continuous variable and using logistic regression for categorical variables by assigning 23 , 62 , 90 , and 100 to categories of overtime work hours , respectively .
Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate odds ratio and its 95 % confidence interval of having diabetes across categories of overtime work hours .
Trend association was assessed by assigning 23 , 62 , 90 , and 100 to each category of overtime .
To test quadratic trend , we used Stata contrast command after running multiple logistic regression .
Model 1 was adjusted for age ( continuous , year ) , sex , and company ( 4 companies ) .
Model 2 was additionally adjusted for smoking ( never , past , or current ) and model 3 for BMI ( continuous , kg / m2 ) .
In one company ( n = 33,807 ) from which detailed information on work and lifestyle was obtained , we additionally adjusted for other potential confounders , including alcohol use ( non - drinker , drinker consuming > 0 to < 23 g , 23 to < 46 g , or ≥ 46 g of ethanol per day ) , family history of diabetes ( yes or no ) , shift work ( yes or no ) , department ( field work or non - field work ) , and job position ( high or low ) in model 2 .
We further adjusted for sleep duration ( < 6 hours , 6 to < 7 hours , or ≥ 7 hours per day ) in model 3 and physical activity ( < 150 min or ≥ 150 min per week ) in model 4 .
We examined the effect modification by shift work ( yes or no ) , type of department ( field work or non - field work ) , smoking habits ( non - smoker or smoker ) , alcohol use ( < 23 g or ≥ 23 g of ethanol / day ) , physical activity ( < 150 min or ≥ 150 min per week ) , and sleep duration ( < 6 hours or ≥ 6 hours ) on the association between overtime work and diabetes using likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without interaction terms in the fully adjusted model treating overtime work as a categorical variable .
We repeated the above analyses after exclusion of subjects under medication for diabetes to minimize the possibility of reverse causality .
Two - sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant .
All analyses were performed using Stata version 12.1 ( StataCorp , College Station , Texas , USA ) .
For this study , we used the definition of IPV from the World Health Organization ( provided above ) [1] , and we included violence by a current or former partner or spouse , whether cohabitating or not .
Inclusion criteria were original research reporting : 1 ) data on the relationship between IPV and HIV ; 2 ) data about the mechanisms of association between IPV and HIV ; or , 3 ) theoretical discussion of the relationships between IPV and HIV .
Studies had to specify their methods in order to be considered original research ; reviews and commentaries were excluded .
Exclusion criteria were studies which 1 ) looked at the association between IPV and HIV risk factors ( instead of HIV infection ) ; or 2 ) assessed violence only in commercial sex work or in non - intimate relationships , e.g. sexual assault by a stranger .
Databases searched were Medline , PsycINFO , CINAHL , Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , Sociological Abstracts , Embase , Web of Science , PapersFirst , ProceedingsFirst , and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses , using a search strategy of text words and indexing terms .
No language or date limits were applied .
The search was conducted in September 2011 for all databases except Sociological Abstracts , for which the search was conducted in December 2011 .
Reference lists of review articles identified in the search and eligible articles were also hand searched .
In addition , authors identified other eligible articles .
In an initial review , two authors independently reviewed all titles and abstracts identified in the search .
Full texts were retrieved if either reviewer determined that they were eligible for review .
Two authors then independently reviewed each full text to assess eligibility , and for those deemed eligible , to extract relevant data .
Disagreements regarding eligibility and extracted data were resolved through discussion .
A hierarchy was used to classify the reason for excluding texts : 1 ) if no original data were included , this was classified as the reason , 2 ) if original data were included but no data on IPV were included , not about IPV was classified as the reason , 3 ) if original data on IPV were included but no data on HIV were included , not about HIV was classified as the reason , and 4 ) if original data on HIV and on IPV were included , but there were no data on the association between IPV and HIV , this was classified as the reason .
When more than one record or paper was identified with data from the same study , all papers were included if they presented different data , or the paper with the earlier date was included if they presented the same data .
Data extraction forms were piloted by two authors and modified accordingly .
Data extracted included study characteristics : study publication year , study period in years , study location , i.e. city , state , and country , study site , e.g. clinic , community - based , school - based , or other , and study type , i.e. cohort , cross - sectional study , etc .
; data regarding IPV : definition , period of exposure , whether experienced or perpetrated ; potential sources of bias ; and qualitative or quantitative data regarding association .
All direct quotations from participants in qualitative studies were included if they described the association between IPV and HIV .
For assessment of bias in quantitative studies , components of a public health critical appraisal tool [11] were considered , with particular focus on selection of participants , measurement of exposure , and handling of confounders .
Type of IPV was categorized as physical , sexual , or verbal , with verbal including verbal , psychological , or emotional IPV , or control .
Geographic Characteristics from Each Method : In Surselva - Gotthard , the division of the regional case study into three towns appeared to strongly influence the business links and network structure ( Fig 2 ) .
Longyearbyen , on the other hand , revealed collaboration clusters that were not associated with geospatial structure ( Figs 2 and 3 ) .
Both case studies revealed how qualitative interviews drawing out geographic characteristics and quantitative SNA drawing out network characteristics can complement each other for understanding how geographic characteristics affect business links .
In Surselva - Gotthard , the interviews interpreted the role of geographic structure in the business network and in the isolation of peripheral actors identified in the SNA .
In Longyearbyen , the interviews revealed weak and diffuse informal ties that were not explicitly identified in the quantitative network .
Those ties are related to the community ’ s smallness and isolation .
Simultaneously , the sparse and modular structure of the quantitative network of business links suggests that the qualitative perception amongst actors of a collaborative business environment may be over - stated .
From the two methods , for Longyearbyen , high population and business turnover alongside compartmentalization of the community into subgroups may support the internal development and application of diverse and new ideas [46] , [52] .
That comes at a cost of less coordinated planning and reduced steering of collective action [52] , and the preference for short - term visions and actions which could be at odds with longer - term interests and approaches , such as environmental and heritage conservation .
In Surselva - Gotthard , a strong sense of place and cultural identity coupled with an efficient , centralized communication structure seems to empower links supporting longer - term visions .
This tight social structure may incur costs of ‘ groupthink ’ [63] if it limits infusion or acceptance of new strategies , products , and services ; that is , a tight social structure can dampen down suggestions of trying out different approaches because it has not been done before or because an individual is in the minority .
Even though isolation and smallness characterise both case studies , they manifested differently in the analyses .
Surselva - Gotthard ’ s actors , spread across three towns within the case study site , displayed isolation from each other in the network , which was then corroborated by the qualitative interviews .
Quantitative SNA captured the isolation of the towns from each other to some degree while qualitative interviews confirmed this result and provided reasons for the isolation .
These findings support similar conclusions such as [62] that clustering rather than geographical tightness occurs when social groups are above 30 members , given that the Surselva - Gotthard case study had more than 30 members and displayed clustering in each town .
The interview responses from Longyearbyen indicated that isolation from the outside world significantly supports informal business links , a characteristic which , in this instance , the quantitative SNA did not immediately detect .
In both case studies , the lack of corroboration by the case studies that technological development makes it easier to link with those at larger distances [42] likely occurred because , as [42] highlights , the German biotechnology inventor networks were heavily knowledge - based , whereas the tourism businesses in Surselva - Gotthard and Longyearbyen use their links more for products and services , rather than for knowledge exchange .
The same explanation applies to this study not providing evidence to support the approach discussed in [37] because their focus is also on knowledge networking .
In this paper , we use the term “ super - group ” to describe groups of 20 or more individual humpback whales estimated to be within five body lengths of their nearest neighbour .
Such observations are novel in that prior observations of feeding by humpback whales in the region ( e.g. [42-44] ) were of loose aggregations of small groups of whales ( of up to 20 individuals ) .
These records of the “ super - groups ” of humpback whales within the southern Benguela region arise from two sources , namely primary observations from dedicated research cruises , and incidental observations reported by the general public .
Three dedicated research cruises were carried out in coastal waters between 32 ° 20 ’ S and 34 ° 20 ’ S off the south - western Cape region of South Africa ( Fig 1 ) in late October - early November of 2011 , 2014 and 2015 and focussed on identifying the distribution , relative abundance and movements of migratory large whales and other cetacean fauna in relation to biotic and abiotic factors ( including upwelling areas ) and the trophic ecology of large whales within this coastal area .
The 2011 cruise was conducted from 10 November to 20 November , the 2014 cruise from 28 October to 8 November , while the 2015 cruise was conducted from 29 October to 7 November .
The 2011 cruise was conducted aboard the South African Department of Environmental Affairs ’ research vessel RV Algoa , while both of the 2014 and 2015 cruises were carried out aboard the South African Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries research vessel the FRS Ellen Khuzwayo ( hereafter both vessels are referred to as “ mothership ” below ) .
During 2014 and 2015 concurrent oceanographic cruises ( to those carried out on the FRS Ellen Khuzwayo ) were carried out in the region aboard the RV Algoa .
Due to limitations in the launching and recovery of rigid hull inflatable boats ( RHIBs ) from the FRS Ellen Khuzwayo in the prevailing south - westerly swell conditions during 2014 and 2015 this vessel generally anchored in sheltered conditions at night with the overnight position defining the area of search effort the following day .
Searching for whales was generally initiated each morning from the bridge or monkey island of the mothership en route to the 100m isobath ( some 5 n . miles offshore ) and positions of whale groups were communicated by radio to one or two RHIBs following astern or parallel to the FRS Ellen Khuzwayo if conditions for RHIB operations allowed .
Once approachable groups of whales were sighted , research personnel were transferred to the RHIBs for approach of whale groups , and RHIBs could be directed from whale group to whale group by the FRS Ellen Khuzwayo , until late afternoon when personnel were transferred back to the ship prior to seeking a sheltered anchorage or providing a lee , if swell conditions allowed for the recovery of the RHIBs .
In 2011 , the RHIBs were deployed from the RV Algoa at sea only once the first approachable whale group was sighted , and thereafter travelled astern or parallel to the mothership between whale groups .
Where weather conditions precluded RHIB operations , whale groups were approached by the mothership .
All approaches to whale groups and all research activities reported in this study were carried out under research permits ( numbers RES 2011 / 70 , RES 2014 / 61 , RES 2015 / 94 ) granted to Mammal Research Institute , University of Pretoria by the South African Department of Environmental Affairs and research permit ( number RES 2015 / DEA ) granted to the South African Department of Environmental Affairs by the Department of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries under provisions of the South African Marine Living Resources Act ( Act 18 of 1998 ) and under ethics permits of the University of Pretoria , South Africa ( Reference numbers - EC 020 - 12 and EC 061 - 15 ) .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0172002.g001 Locations of the Study Region and dedicated ( open circles ) and incidental observations ( open squares ) of feeding “ super - groups ” off the south west Cape coast of South Africa .
The 200m isobath is shown .
The inset expands the area shaded in grey .
Due to the tight spacing and repeated diving behaviour of whales within “ super - groups ” ( at times less than 2 - 3 m apart ) and the high risk of entangling whales within sampling gear , no plankton sampling could be carried out from the RHIBs in the near vicinity of these groups .
Group sizes of dedicated sightings were estimated independently by experienced observers as upper , lower and best estimates during the close approaches of the group , either by RHIBs or by the mothership so that group size estimates were not carried out at distance and consequently not influenced by Beaufort Scale or Sea State .
Best estimates of group size were not necessarily the mean of the overall upper and lower estimates as independent estimates were made by all of the personnel observing the group and the final estimated group size was based on consensus of these individual estimates .
The estimates of the sizes of “ super - groups ” pertain only to those individuals within five body lengths of the nearest neighbour at the time of the largest aggregation during the encounter .
Fluidity of the associations within groups and movement of identified individuals between groups within aggregations ( including in and out of “ super - groups ” ) was difficult to determine in the field , due to the repetitive deep dive behaviour of the individual whales , which made the determination of group sizes difficult .
Where such difficulty precluded accurate group size estimation , the lowest estimate was selected .
Incidental observations of “ super - groups ” were reported by the general public from aircraft during 2015 including during two sightseeing flights made by DH between Koeberg and St Helena Bay ( including offshore of Dassen Island ) on 19 October and 26 October 2015 .
These two flights were carried out at over 300m above sea level in a Cessna 185 aircraft .
All of the reported incidental observations were verified from photographs .
Group size estimates of the incidental sightings were estimated by the observers who recorded these sightings .
Although other reports were received from boat - based and shore - based observers these have been excluded from the database as they were not accompanied by adequate photographic verification .
The goal of reinforcement learning is to find the policy π - a set of rules to select an action in each possible state - that would maximize the agent ’ s accumulated long term reward in a dynamical environment .
The problem is especially challenging when the agent must learn without explicit information about the dynamics of the environment or the rewards .
The reinforcement learning problem is usually modeled as a Markov decision process ( MDP ) giving rise to a sequence of observed , states , actions and rewards - s0 , a0 , r 1 , s1 , a1 , r 2 , s2 , … , sT .
The st is the state of the environment , at the action taken by the agent and rt the reward received by the agent at time - step t .
One episode ( game ) lasts T time steps , and different episodes can be of different length .
The goal of the agent is to maximize the sum of rewards r 1 + r 2 + … + rT ( the total game score ) .
One popular method to solve MDPs is Q - learning [14] .
Q - learning is based on estimating the expected total discounted future rewards ( the quality ) of each state - action pair under a policy π : Q π ( st , at ) = E [ rt + 1 + γ rt + 2 + γ 2rt + 2 + … + γ T - trT | π ] .
( 1 ) Here γ is a discount rate between 0 and 1 that makes future rewards less valuable than immediate ones and helps to cope with infinite MDPs .
The optimal quality value is then Q * ( st , at ) = max π Q π ( st , at ) .
Hence an optimal policy is easily derived from the optimal values by selecting the highest valued action in each state , and the problem only amounts to obtaining accurate Q - values .
Given state s , action a , reward r and next state s ′ , it is possible to approximate Q * ( s , a ) by iteratively solving the Bellman recurrence equation [1] : Qi + 1 ( s , a ) = E [ r + γ maxa ′ Qi ( s ′ , a ′ ) ] .
( 2 ) When the state - action space is small enough for the Q - values to be represented as a lookup table , this iterative approximation is proved to converge to the true Q - values [15] , provided that all state - action pairs are regularly sampled .
However , the combinatorial explosion of the number of possible states in even a modest - size environment makes this table based implementation of Q - learning unfeasible .
This problem can be partially overcome by function approximation methods .
Instead of storing each Q - value , their aim is to learn a function that maps state - action pairs to their respective Q - values .
Deep Q - network ( DQN ) builds on standard Q - learning by approximating the Q - function using a non - linear neural network .
The neural network , parametrized by θ , is trained to minimize the loss function : L ( θ ) = E [ ( r + γ maxa ′ Q ( s ′ , a ′ ; θ ′ ) target - Q ( s , a ; θ ) prediction ) 2 ] ( 3 ) Notice that the formula closely reassembles the iterative update rule of the Bellmann equation mentioned above ( Eq 2 ) .
Essentially , the goal is to minimize the difference between the current estimation of the Q - value ( prediction ) , and an updated estimate ( target ) that combines the obtained reward and an estimation of the quality of the next state .
There is no proof of convergence for Q - learning with non - linear function approximators .
To overcome learning instability , all experiences ( s , a , r , s ′ ) are stored in a “ replay memory ” and are sampled uniformly as training examples .
This ensures that the examples are uncorrelated and do not drive the policy to a local minima .
Furthermore , a separate target network ( with parameters θ ′ in the formula above ) is used for estimating the maximal Q - value .
The target network ’ s weights are updated at certain intervals to be equal with those of the main network .
Between updates these target Q - values remain unchanged and provide some much needed stability .
To balance the exploitation of the current best known Q - values with the exploration of even better options , DQN uses a simple ϵ - greedy policy that samples a random action with probability ϵ ( instead of always picking the action with maximal Q - value ) .
When ϵ is annealed over time , this simple strategy is known to work just as well as more complex exploration strategies [1] .
There exist several possible adaptations of the Q - learning algorithm for the multiagent case [5] .
However , this is an open research area and theoretical guarantees for multiagent model - free reinforcement learning algorithms are scarce and restricted to specific types of tasks [ 3 , 5 ] .
In practice the simplest method consists of using an autonomous Q - learning algorithm for each agent in the environment , thereby using the environment as the sole source of interaction between agents .
In this work we use this method due to its simplicity , decentralized nature , computational speed , and ability to produce consistent results for the range of tasks we report .
Therefore , in our tests each agent is controlled by an independent DQN with architecture and parameters as reported in [7] .
Adaptation of the code for the multiplayer paradigm : We needed to introduce several adaptations to the original code published with [7] to allow training multiple agents simultaneously .
These changes are summarized in supplementary information ( SI ) section .
We chose to use the Pong game environment in our study for reasons summarized in the SI .
In short , there are three advantages for illustrating our results with Pong : i ) the Pong game has a real - time two player mode , ii ) DQNs are good in Pong and iii ) the game is well - known and can be easily understood by the reader .
In Pong each agent corresponds to one of the paddles situated on the left and right side of the screen ( see screenshots in Results section ) .
There are 4 actions that each of the two agents can take : move up , move down , stand still , and fire ( to relaunch the ball or to start the game ) .
Which action is taken is decided by the corresponding DQN for both agents separately .
A central aim of this work is to study the emergence of different types of collective behavior depending on how the agents are rewarded .
We adjust the rewarding scheme by simply changing the reward ρ a player receives when putting the ball past the opponent ( when scoring ) .
This essentially means , that we change the values on the main diagonal of the payoff matrix , given in Table 1 .
The reward for conceding is kept fixed at - 1 .
This way we are able create several different games within the same Pong environment .
Examples of the used rewarding schemes are given in the following subsection * s .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0172395.t001 Rewarding schemes to explore the transition from competitive to the cooperative strategy .
For the cases we study ρ ∈ [ − 1 , 1 ] .
Example : with ρ = − 0.5 , when the left player scores , it receives − 0.5 points and the right player receives - 1 points .
Score more than the opponent ( fully competitive ) : In the traditional rewarding scheme of Pong , also used in [7] , the player who scores a point gets a positive reward of size 1 ( ρ = 1 ) .
The player conceding a point is penalized with a reward of - 1 .
This makes it essentially a zero - sum game , where a positive reward for the left player implies a negative reward of the same size for the right player and vice versa .
Notice that ρ = 1 is the only case where the rewards of the two players sum up to zero , for all ρ < 1 the sum of rewards is negative .
Loosing the ball penalizes both players ( fully cooperative ) : In this setting we want the agents to learn to keep the ball in the game for as long as possible .
To achieve this , we penalize both of the players whenever the ball goes out of play - both scoring and conceding lead to a punitive reward of − 1 ( ρ = − 1 ) .
Which of the players lets the ball pass does not matter and no positive rewards are given .
Transition between cooperation and competition : The above two rewarding schemes define fully competitive and fully collaborative tasks .
To study the behavioral patterns lying between these two extremes we gradually reduce the reward difference between scoring and conceding .
The reward for conceding is kept fixed at - 1 , while a set of intermediate values are given to the ρ parameter .
In all of the experiments we let the agents learn for 50 epochs , 250000 time steps each .
We limit the learning to 50 epochs because the Q - values predicted by the network have stabilized ( see S1 Fig ) .
Due to using a frame skipping technique the agents see and select actions only on every 4th frame [7] .
In this article we always talk about the frames the agents actually see and so we use “ visible frame ” , “ frame ” and “ time step ” interchangeably .
During the training time , as in [7] , the exploration rate ( proportion of actions chosen randomly ) decreases from an initial 1.0 to 0.05 in the first million time steps and stays fixed at that value .
A more detailed description of the training procedure and parameters can be found in [7] .
After each epoch snapshots of the DQNs are stored to facilitate the future study of the training process .
We also track the average maximal Q - value , which has been previously used as an indicator of training convergence ( see SI ) .
To guarantee a fair comparison between different rewarding schemes , we need the training signal to be equally strong in all cases .
Rewards are the signal that agents use to evaluate their performance and that they learn from .
For each scheme , we multiply the rewards with a normalization coefficient so that the sum of their absolute values would be equal .
The rewarding schemes and the normalization coefficients are listed in S1 Table .
To obtain quantitative measures of the agents ’ behavior in the Pong environment , we identified and counted specific events in the game , e.g. bouncing of the ball against the paddle or the wall .
We used Stella [16] integrated debugger to detect the memory locations containing information about these events .
Based on these counts we defined a set of behavioral metrics listed below .
The statistics are collected after each training epoch by letting the DQNs ( in their current state ) play against each other for 10 games , each game initialized with a different random seed ( In Pong one game consists of multiple exchanges and lasts until one of the agents reaches 21 points . ) .
During this testing phase the exploration rate is set to 0.01 .
The behavioral measures we used are the following : Average paddle - bounces per point counts how many times the ball bounces between two players before one of them scores a point .
Randomly playing agents almost never hit the ball .
Well trained agents hit the ball multiple times in an exchange .
Hereafter we refer to this statistic as paddle - bounces.Average wall - bounces per paddle - bounce quantifies how many times the ball bounces from top and bottom walls before it reaches the other player .
It is possible to hit the ball in an acute angle so that it bounces the walls several times before reaching the other player .
Depending on the strategy , players might prefer to send the ball directly to the other player or use the wall bounces .
Hereafter we refer to this statistic as wall - bounces.Average serving time per point shows how long it takes for the players to restart the game after the ball was lost ( measured in frames ) .
To restart the game , the agent who just scored has to send a specific command ( fire ) .
Depending on the rewarding scheme the agents might want to avoid restarting the game .
Hereafter we refer to this statistic as serving time .
RRMS patients conforming to the McDonald diagnostic criteria [33] , [34] were contacted for the study .
Inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) mild to moderate neurological disability , but with unimpaired ambulation ( Expanded Disability Status Scale [ EDSS ] ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 ) [35] ; ( 2 ) no clinical relapse and no corticosteroid therapy for at least six weeks before inclusion in the study ; ( 3 ) no diagnosis of major depression , alcohol or drug abuse or other psychiatric disorders according to the DSM - IV criteria .
Seventy - two patients , aged between 18 and 48 years old , were analyzed .
Thirty - nine patients were treated with disease - modifying therapies ( interferon β - 1a or 1b in most cases ) for a mean period of 3.3 years ( ranging from two months to nine years ) , ten were taking antidepressants for minor mood symptoms which were not severe enough to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for depression as assessed in a psychiatric interview , and five had had symptomatic treatment for fatigue ( amantadine or modafinil ) .
The control group consisted of 38 healthy volunteers matched for age , gender and education , with no history of alcohol or drug abuse , major psychiatric disorders ( major depression , psychosis , untreated bipolar disorders ) , head trauma , other neurological disorders , or systemic illness .
Standard Protocol Approvals , Registrations and Patient Consents : The study was approved by the local university ’ s Ethics Committee , and all subjects gave written informed consent for their participation in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki .
The Name of the Ethic Committee is the following : “ Commission d ’ Ethique de la recherche clinique , Faculte de medecine et de biologie , Universite de Lausanne , Switzerland ” .
The name of the accepted project ( 2007 ) was : “ Dissecting the decisional process in patients with Multiple Sclerosis ” .
In order to maintain motivation , participants were informed that they would receive money as a function of their final gains in the DM tasks .
For ethical reasons , in actual fact they all received 20 Swiss Francs at the end of the study .
All participants underwent a neuropsychological examination , to test whether DM deficits were associated with specific pattern of cognitive deficits .
The Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests ( BRB - N ) [36] , [37] was used to assess verbal memory ( Selective Reminding Test [ SRT ] ) , spatial memory ( 10 / 36 Spatial Recall Test ) , sustained attention / information processing speed ( 3 - second version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [ PASAT ] , Symbol Digit Modalities Test [ SDMT ] ) , and verbal fluency in semantic cues ( Word List Generation [ WLG ] ) .
In addition to the BRB - N , we administered a task which assessed more complex executive skills ( Stockings of Cambridge [ SOC ] from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery [ CANTAB ] ) [38] .
At the end of the second testing session , subjects filled out questionnaires assessing mood ( Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale , HAD ) [39] and behavioral changes ( Dysexecutive Questionnaire , DEX ) [40] .
The DEX was used for quantifying behavioral disturbances commonly associated with executive impairment and has already been used in MS studies [41] .
This last questionnaire was aimed at investigating whether specific behavioural changes / symptoms in MS are associated with eventual DM changes .
The 20 items of the DEX encompass broad areas of likely changes ( impulsivity , apathy , desinhibition , intentionality , etc . ) .
Each item is scored on a 5 - point scale ranging from “ never ” to “ very often ” ( 0 to 4 ) .
The Wheels of Fortune ( WOF ) task [23] was used to measure the emotional strategies associated with DM under risk .
This task had previously shown that advantageous decisions in healthy controls could be induced through prior experiencing disappointment and regret ( Fig . 1A ) [23] .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0050718.g001 Description of the two gambling tasks.A ) Wheel of Fortune ( WOF ) : the subject ( with SCR recorded ) has to choose between two possible lotteries with different risk and earning possibilities .
The subject was asked to choose one of the two wheels by pressing a left or a right button ( choice period ) .
A spinning arrow then appeared at the center of the wheel , spins for a variable duration ( wait period ) , and stopped revealing the outcome ( s ) ( feedback period ) .
In the partial feedback condition ( 30 trials ) the subject does not know the outcome of the other lottery ; in the complete feedback condition ( 30 trials ) both outcomes are presented .
At the end of each trial , subjects had to indicate their affective state using a rating scale .
B ) Cambridge gambling task ( CGT ) : the subject has to bet points on a choice associated with a given level of risk .
Trials are run in blocks ( two sets of four blocks ) , each containing nine trials .
A row of ten boxes ( red or blue , with a ratio varying across trials ) is presented at the top of the screen .
Participants are told that a yellow token was hidden in one of the boxes .
They then have to guess whether it is in a red or blue box ( color ) .
Then they decide how many of their points they wanted to gamble on their choice ( point choice ) by pressing when they choose : available bets ( 5 , 25 , 75 , 95 and total ) are presented on the right of the screen in a ascending or descending sequence .
Then feedback is given about gain or loss and total ongoing fortune ( left ) .
Two wheels were presented on a computer screen ( Gamble 1 and Gamble 2 ) .
Each wheel was divided into two sectors ( black and light blue ) associated with different amounts of money .
The size of each sector represented the probability of obtaining the proposed outcome .
The possible outcomes for each individual gamble were visible on the screen and were formed by any pair of the following values : − 50 , + 50 , − 200 , + 200 ( units corresponding to cents in Swiss francs ) , and associated with different outcome probabilities ( 0.8 , 0.2 , and 0.5 ) .
The subject was asked to choose one of the two wheels by pressing a left or a right button ( choice period ) .
A spinning arrow then appeared at the center of the wheel , turned for a variable duration ( wait period ) , and stopped in one of the two sectors , revealing the outcome which resulted in a financial gain or loss ( feedback period ) .
At the end of each trial , subjects had to indicate their affective state using a rating scale ranging from − 50 ( extremely sad ) to + 50 ( extremely happy ) .
The task included two conditions given in separate blocks .
In the “ partial feedback ” condition ( PF ; 30 trials ) , the spinning arrow and the related outcome were apparent for the selected wheel only .
In this condition , the unfavorable comparison of the obtained outcome with a more favorable counterfactual ( i.e. , unobtained ) outcome may have induced disappointment related to the financial consequence of a decision [23] .
By contrast , in the “ complete feedback ” condition ( CF ; 30 trials ) , spinning arrows appeared , rotated and stopped in both the selected and the non - selected wheels , revealing both outcomes to the participants .
CF trials induced not only disappointment but also regret , by showing the outcome that would have been obtained if participants had selected the other gamble ( counterfactual outcome ) .
Skin conductance responses ( SCRs ) were recorded during the WOF task using the PowerLab / GSR amplifier system ( AD Instruments GmbH , Spechbach , Germany ) .
This was done in order to obtain the physiological correlate of regret , which consisted of an increase of SCRs in the CF condition due to counterfactual processing , as compared to the PF condition of the WOF .
The SCRs represent an indicator of sympathetic nervous system activation , which is believed to contribute to the process of making advantageous choices for the organism .
SCR data were acquired continuously using flat - surface electrodes placed on the non - dominant hand and stored for off - line analysis using a second computer running Chart v 4.2 software .
The SCRs of interest were those generated during the five - second interval following the viewing of the obtained outcome ( feedback period , post - choice SCRs ) .
Sixty five - second time points were recorded for each subject .
Artefactual signals ( e.g. , the subject ’ s movements ) were cleared manually .
Mean amplitudes ( microSiemens , μ S ) recorded during each five - second time window were analyzed ( i.e. , the mean of the data points obtained in the five - second selection ) .
Baseline SCR activity was assessed using three measurements per subject recorded : ( 1 ) at rest ; ( 2 ) in response to a loud noise ; and ( 3 ) after a deep breath .
This method had been applied in a previous study [11] and had been shown to be reliable .
The Cambridge Gamble Task ( CGT ) [21] was used to measure DM ( Fig . 1B ) .
Participants sat in front of a computer touch screen .
Trials were run in blocks ( two sets of four blocks per subject ) , each containing nine trials .
A block could finish prematurely if it ended in bankruptcy .
At the beginning of each block , they were given 100 points .
A row of ten boxes ( red or blue , with a ratio varying across the trials ) was presented at the top of the screen and participants were told that a yellow token was hidden in one of the boxes .
They then had to guess whether it was in a red or blue box and to decide how many of their points they wanted to gamble on their choice ( 5 % , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % or 95 % , given in a progressively ascending or descending order depending on the blocks ) .
A winning choice was rewarded by the total of points gambled , whereas a losing choice was punished by subtracting that number of points .
The probability of each choice being correct was indicated to the subjects by the ratio between red and blue boxes .
This produced a variety of situations , ranging from those in which one outcome was the most likely ( e.g. , nine red boxes to one blue box ) to those in which both outcomes were almost equally likely ( six to four ) .
We used the standard version provided by CANTAB ( http://www.cantab.com/cantab-tests-cambridge-gambling-task.asp ) with a 5 ∶ 5 ratio of red - blue boxes also included in the design to ensure that participants perceived the task as a random trial sequence .
Therefore , it was hypothesized that the CGT allowed participants to apply cognitive strategies , such as probabilistic judgment , in order to decide advantageously .
The ascending and descending sequence in which potential wins were proposed enabled us to differentiate patients with impulsive response tendencies from patients with real risk preference ( i.e. , risk - preferent patients had to wait if they wanted to place high bets in the ascending conditions ) .
Measures of behavior choices were quality of DM ( the proportion of trials where participants chose the more likely outcome ) and deliberation time .
Statistical analyses were conducted using a STATA software package ( Version 10.0 ) .
Non - parametric tests were applied to all the demographic and behavioral data because ( 1 ) the CGT and WOF data could not be transformed successfully to reach normality , and ( 2 ) the distribution of the WOF emotional ratings is by definition non - normal as the scale is restricted ( values available from − 50 to + 50 ) and thus cannot be considered as a continuous variable .
Differences were examined using Chi 2 tests for the comparison of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank tests for the comparison of continuous variables .
To measure the possible influences of executive , attentional and emotional variables on decisional performances , we then computed single Spearman correlation analyses with certain outcome measures in the following executive tasks : SOC , SDMT , and PASAT .
For the WOF task , we first analyzed the emotional evaluations of decisional outcomes and then tested two models of choice computed by regression analyses , using a panel logit procedure with an individual random effect .
The panel data analysis took each subject as the unit and the trial as the time .
The random effects model was used as the default model , and the parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood .
This statistical procedure is extensively described elsewhere [23] , [26] .
The first model integrated the effects of anticipating disappointment ( d , negative emotion expressed in the PF condition when facing a negative outcome ) and regret ( r , negative emotion induced by the counterfactual comparison of a negative obtained outcome with a more advantageous outcome for the rejected alternative ) in addition to the maximization of expected values ( EV , choices of the most favorable odds , reflecting quality of DM and risk taking ) .
In fact , as we have already mentioned , a subject obtaining an outcome lower than expected might experience disappointment or regret .
The greater the difference between the expected and the obtained outcome , the more intense this negative feeling will be .
Thus , to avoid future disappointment or regret , the subject might progressively adapt his or her choice behavior by selecting a gamble that minimizes the difference between the lowest and highest outcomes , weighted by the probability of the worst possible outcome .
This is what we call anticipation of disappointment and regret .
In the second model [42] , we used the logit regression to estimate the probability of the participant choosing the first gamble , as a function of the difference in EV ( dEV ) and standard deviation ( a measure of risk ) between the first and second lottery : The variables dEV and risk are defined as follows : where x1 , y1 and x2 , y2 are the two possible outcomes of the first and the second lotteries respectively , with x1 > y1 , and x2 > y2 .
The probability of x1 is p and the probability of y1 is ( 1 - p ) .
The probability of x2 is q and the probability of y2 is ( 1 - q ) .
Thus a positive ( negative ) and significant dEV or risk coefficient indicates that subjects consistently choose the lottery with the highest ( lowest ) expected value or level of risk respectively .
For the CGT , choice behavior and betting behavior were analyzed separately [30] on the basis of the scores calculated through the CGT program .
It should be noted that trials with a 5 ∶ 5 ratio of red - blue boxes , included in the design to mimic a random trial sequence , were excluded from the statistical analyses .
The analysis of the participant ’ s betting behavior was also limited to the trials in which the subjects chose the most likely color , in order to maintain independence from choice behavior .
The patients ’ and controls ’ scores were directly compared using Mann - Whitney non parametric tests .
Culture of Cancer Cell Lines : The authenticated ( RADIL , Columbia , MO ) , human pancreatic cancer cell lines BXPC - 3 ( witout ras mutations ) and Panc - 1 ( expresses activating point mutations in K - ras ) originally purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) were grown in RPMI - 1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum without antibiotics .
A ) Determination of cell proliferation by MTT assay : The colorimetric 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethyle thiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyl tetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay ( Sigma ) was used as previously described [38] to assess the growth stimulating effects of chronic epinephrine exposure and potential inhibitory effects of celecoxib on this response in Panc - 1 and BXPC - 3 cells in vitro .
Briefly , Panc - 1 and BxPC - 3 cells were seeded into 6 - well plates ( 50,000 cells per well ) .
Cells were then pretreated with 15 nM epinephrine for 7 days ( medium containing epinephrine was replaced every 24 hours ) or cultured for 7 days without epinephrine .
Celecoxib ( 1 nM to 100 μ M ) was then added to cells from both treatment groups .
Following a 72 hour incubation period , all cells were harvested .
B ) Assessment of cell migration by colorimetric assay : Cell migration assays were conducted as previously described [36] , using 6 - well plates with filter inserts provided by the colorimetric cell migration assay kit ( Cell Biolabs , San Diego , CA , USA ) .
Panc - 1 and BxPC - 3 cells were pretreated with 15 nM epinephrine for 7 days ( medium containing epinephrine was replaced every 24 hours ) in tissue culture flasks or cultured without epinephrine for 7 days .
Cells from both treatment groups were then seeded into the inserts and treated with celecoxib ( 1 nM to 100 μ M ) for 24 hours .
The migratory ability of cells was then assessed following the vendor ’ s instructions .
C ) Statistical evaluation of in vitro data : Data ( n = 5 ) in column graphs ( Fig . 1 ) from the cell proliferation and cell migration assays in the presence and absence of chronic epinephrine treatment were assessed by one - way analysis of variance followed by Dunn ’ s multiple comparison test .
Data ( n = 5 ) from the dose - response experiments ( Fig . 2 ) with celecoxib were fitted to sigmoidal dose - response curves and EC 50 values for celecoxib were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism GraphPad software .

Exposure for 7 days to epinephrine ( 15 nM ) significantly ( p < 0.001 ) increased the number of viable cell in both cell lines .
The Cox - 2 inhibitor celecoxib ( 1 μ M ) completely blocked this response to epinephrine ( p < 0.001 ) while additionally reducing ( p < 0.001 ) the number of viable cells in cells not pre - treated with epinephrine .
The effects of identical treatments on cell migration are shown in Fig .
B .
In both cell lines migration was significantly more stimulated by chronic epinephrine than cell proliferation .
Celecoxib significantly ( p < 0.001 ) reduced epinephrine - induced migration but did not completely block this response .
BCPC - 3 cells were slightly more responsive to epinephrine in both assays , but the differences between the two cell lines were not significant .

Six - week - old male athymic nude mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley .
The animal research protocol was approved by the University of Tennessee Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee .
The mice were acclimated for 1 week and maintained in our laboratory animal facility in accordance with guidelines of the American Association of Laboratory Animal Care under standard laboratory conditions in which temperature , humidity , and light are controlled , and had free access to autoclaved Purina Rodent Chow food and autoclaved water .
Following the 1 - week acclimation , the ears of the mice were tagged to facilitate the monitoring of each animal , which was then randomly assigned to six treatment groups ( n = 20 ) , with 5 mice per cage .
Before tumor cell inoculation , mice in the three psychological stress groups were exposed to social stress for 4 weeks according to the published procedure [37] by changing the group composition of each cage twice a week .
BXPC - 3 cells that had reached 75 % confluency in culture were then subcutaneously inoculated in the flank region ( 3 × 106 in 0.2 ml of PBS , viability > 95 % ) of animals from each of these groups .
Social stress was continued in these three groups for another 30 days .
Three other groups of mice that were not exposed to social stress were also inoculated with identical numbers of pancreatic cancer BXPC - 3 cells .
One group each from the social stress and non - social stress populations was treated by intraperitoneal injections of celecoxib ( Celebrex , Pfizer ; 25 mg / Kg b.w . , 5 days / week for 30 days ) .
Additionally , one group each from the social stress and non - social stress populations was simultaneously treated by initial intraperitoneal injections of celecoxib ( 25 mg / Kg b.w . , 5 days / week for 30 days ) and then GABA ( Sigma ; 10 mg / Kg b.w . , 5 days / week for 30 days ) immediately thereafter on the mouse ’ s opposite side .
All animals were observed for 30 days after inoculation with cancer cells .
Tumor sizes were evaluated weekly by digital caliper , and two perpendicular diameters ( length and width ) of each xenograft were measured using the following formula : tumor volume = ( length / 2 ) × ( width 2 ) .
The weight of the animals was followed throughout the experiment to monitor their general health state and for GABA and celecoxib treatment effects .
At the end of the 30 - day observation period , the animals were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation .
Blood samples were collected for the determination of neurotransmitters , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and prostaglandin E2 ( PGE 2 ) in the serum and of cAMP in the cellular fraction of blood .
The tumors were excised , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen , and then stored at − 80 ° C for further analyses .
B ) Immunoassays for the quantitative analysis of the second messenger cAMP , VEGF , PGE 2 , and phosphorylated signaling proteins : VEGF and PGE 2 in serum and tumor tissue samples and cAMP in the cellular fraction of blood and tumor tissues samples were analyzed by immunoassays as recommended by the manufacturer ( Enzo Life Sciences International ) .
Briefly , the kit for measurement of cAMP uses a polyclonal antibody to bind a competitive manner the cAMP in the standards and samples .
The kit for measurement of VEGF uses monoclonal antibody to human VEGF immobilized in a microtiter plate to bind the VEGF in the standards or samples .
The PGE 2 kit uses a monoclonal antibody to PGE 2 to bind in a competitive manner the PGE 2 in the samples and standards .
Absorbances were read with an ELISA reader at 405 nm for cAMP , 450 nm for PGE 2 , and at 450 nm for VEGF ( n = 5 per treatment group ) .
Detection and quantitation of levels of p - ERK - 1 / 2 at threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 , p - CREB at serine at 133 , and p - Akt at serine residue 473 ( Invitrogen ) ; and kinase activity of the recombinant catalytic domain of p - Src ( MBL International ) were conducted from tumor tissue samples ( n = 5 per treatment group ) homogenized in RIPA buffer and protease inhibitors as recommended by the manufacturers .
Absorbance was read with an ELISA reader at 450 nm .
Serum and tumor levels of the stress neurotransmitters noradrenaline and adrenaline as well as GABA were determined by ELISA assays as previously described [14] , [18] to monitor the successful induction of psychological stress ( data not shown ) .
C ) Semi - quantitative analysis of COX - 2 , 5 - lipooxygenase ( 5 - LOX ) and p - 5 - LOX , and non - quantitative visualization of signaling proteins by western blotting : Three independent Western blots were conducted for each antibody for the semi - quantitative assessment of protein expression by densitometry for the AA - metabolizing enzymes COX - 2 and p - 5 - LOX , using NIH Image J software .
In addition , protein expression of the signaling molecules quantitated by ELISA assays above were visualized by non - quantitative Western blots .
Briefly , tumor tissues were briefly homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer ( Thermo Scientific ) , PMSF , Na3VO 4 , and 1 mg / ml aprotinin , leupeptin , and pepstatin .
After heat denaturation at 100 ° C for 5 min , equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed using 12 % Novex SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( Invitrogen ) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ; Western blots were then performed using incubation overnight at 4 ° C with the following primary antibodies : total ERK 1 / 2 , p - ERK 1 / 2 , p - CREB , AKT p - AKT , Src , p - Src , COX - 2 , 5 - LOX , and p - 5 - LOX ( Cell Signaling ) .
Total CREB and actin were purchased from Millipore .
Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature .
Bands were visualized by ECL ( Pierce , Thermo Scientific ) .
D ) Statistical analysis of in vivo data : Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Instat software ( GraphPad Software Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
To test if the variation among column medians of tumor volumes in the six treatment groups ( n = 20 ) was significantly greater than expected by chance , nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA was performed for data from each of the 4 weeks after injection of tumor cells .
Differences between selected pairs of treatment groups were additionally assessed by the nonparametric Mann - Whitney test .
Statistical significance of differences among groups for levels of cAMP ( n = 5 ) , PGE 2 ( n = 5 ) , and VEGF ( n = 5 ) in blood and xenograft tissues and for p - ERK , p - CREB , p - Src , and p - AKT in tumor tissue ( n = 5 per treatment group ) was assessed by the non - parametric Mann - Whitney test .
Statistical significance of differences between four densitometric readings per protein band from three independent Western blots for the semi - quantitative assessment of COX - 2 and p - 5 - LOX prepared from three randomly selected xenografts per treatment group ( n = 12 ) was assessed by the non - parametric Mann - Whitney test .
Bacterial strains , plasmids and growth conditions : Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1 , and primers used in this study are listed in S1 Table .
A spontaneous rifampicin - resistant strain of P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 and its derivatives were grown at 28 ° C in Luria - Bertani medium ( LB ) ( 5 g of NaCl per liter ) , AB minimal media ( AB ) , AB amended with 2 % casamino acids ( AB - C ) ( Difco , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , or pigment production medium - D ( PPM - D ) [ 16 , 17 , 40 , 44 ] .
Where applicable , antibiotics were used in the following concentrations : gentamicin ( Gn ; 50 μ g / ml ) , kanamycin ( Km ; 50 μ g / ml ) , rifampicin ( Rif ; 100 μ g / ml ) , tetracycline ( Tc ; 50 μ g / ml ) and piperacillin ( Pip ; 50 μ g / ml ) for P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 , and ampicillin Ap ( 100 μ g / ml ) , Gn ( 15 μ g / ml ) , Tc ( 25 μ g / ml ) for E . coli .
DNA manipulations , sequence analysis , and PCR : Standard methods were utilized for plasmid DNA isolation , restriction enzyme digestion , ligation , transformation , and agarose gel electrophoresis [63] .
Plasmids were introduced into P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 and its derivatives using either triparental matings or electroporation using methods described previously [ 1 , 40 ] .
Standard polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) were carried out using FideliTaq DNA polymerase ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) as described previously [45] .
DNA sequencing was performed by the Laboratory for Genome Technology within Institute for Plant Genomics and Biotechnology , Texas A&M University using an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer .
To obtain the nucleotide sequence upstream of phenazine biosynthetic operon , the 250 bp nucleotide sequence upstream of the translation start site of phzX were blasted against the Pseudomonas Genome Database ( www.pseudomonas.com ) and National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) .
A total of 27 phenazine producing strains were retrieved and analyzed for the types of a phenazine modifying enzyme .
The nucleotide sequences ( 250 bp flanking sequences from the translation start site of each strain ’ s phenazine biosynthetic operon ) were aligned and edited using MUSCLE ( MEGA 7 ) .
MEGA 7 was used to build a , Maximum Likelihood ( ML ) trees based on the Tamura - Nei Model [64] [65] .
ML bootstrapping was performed with 1,000 replicates to assess the relative stability of the branches .
Construction of phzX transcriptional fusion derivatives : To determine the function of the 5 ’ - UTR of phenazine biosynthetic operon in phenazine gene expression , a 1.5 - Kb DNA fragment contains a deletion of 90 - bp in the 5 ’ - UTR of phenazine biosynthetic operon was synthesized ( GeneScript , Piscataway , NJ ) and obtained as pUC 57 - Enh ( Table 1 ) .
This fragment lacks 90 - bp of sequence ( including both SspI sites and the second direct repeat ) starting at the + 8 bp ( from the TSS ) to the RBS of phzX , but maintaining the endogenous RBS and start codon of PhzX .
PCR fragments of 271 bp and 181 bp containing sequence from - 124 to + 147 of phzX were amplified from genomic DNA of P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 and pUC 57 - Enh using the primers , phzXF 1 / phzXR 1 ( S1 Table ) and cloned into the promoter trap vector pGT 2 - lacZ resulting plasmids pJMYX 1 and pJMYX 2 , respectively ( Fig 2 and Table 1 ) .
To determine the function of upstream sequence of phenazine biosynthetic promoter region , PCR fragments of 354bp ( from - 124 to + 230 ) , 310bp ( from - 80 to + 230 ) , and 274bp ( from - 44 to + 230 ) containing the promoter of phenazine biosynthetic operon , 5 ’ - UTR and 115bp of phzX coding sequence were amplified from P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 genomic DNA using the following primer sets , phzXF 1 / phzXR 2 , phzXF 2 / phzXR 2 and phzXF 3 / phzXR 2 , respectively ( S1 Table ) These fragments were cloned into the promoter trap vectors pKT 2 - lacZ , creating the plasmids pJMYX 3 , pJMYX 4 and pJMYX 5 , respectively ( Table 1 and Fig 2 ) .
The plasmids pKT 2 - lacZ and pGT 2 - lacZ contain a promoterless lacZ gene with its own ribosome binding site ( RBS ) located downstream of multiple cloning locus , which enables the study of transcriptional activities .
All transcriptional fusion plasmids were separately introduced into 30 - 84Ice via triparental mating and the transcriptional activity was determined by β - galactosidase activity [66] in 30 - 84Ice after 24 h growth in LB with rapid agitation .
Strain 30 - 84Ice was used for the transcriptional fusion assays because it contains a phzB : : inaZ insertion ( Table 1 ) and as a consequence does not produce phenazine , which interferes with the β - galactosidase assay .
Generation of a phenazine enhanced mutant : In order to generate the phenazine enhanced mutant strain , the 1.5 Kb sequence from pUC 57 - Enh was cloned into the vector , pLAFR 3 , generating pLAF - phzEnh ( Table 1 ) .
This 1.5 Kb fragment contains flanking regions upstream from the EcoRV site in the first half of phzR and downstream to the BamHI site at the 3 ’ - end of phzY ( the second gene of phz operon ) to facilitate homologous recombination .
The pLAF - phzEnh plasmid was introduced into P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 strains containing pUCP 18 - RedS via triparental mating , and the chromosomal 90 - bp deletion of 5 ’ - UTR of phenazine biosynthetic operon was obtained with the support of λ phage recombinases [ 40 , 48 ] .
A dark orange colony ( for 30 - 84Enh ) from the PPMD plate or a dark blue colony ( for 30 - 84ZN - Enh ) from PPMD plate supplemented with 2 % X - gal were chosen , and pUCP 18 - RedS plasmid ( containing sacB ) was cured by counter selection on LB plates supplemented with 5 % sucrose .
A Tcs , Pips , and SucroseR colony was chosen and mutation was verified by PCR and sequencing .
Construction of an rsmE deletion mutant : To inactivate rsmE gene in P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 , fragments of upstream ( 611 bp ) and downstream ( 706 bp ) of the rsmE open reading frame ( ORF ) were amplified from P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 genomic DNA using primers RsmEUPF / RsmEUPR and RsmEDWF / RsmEDWR ( S1 Table ) .
These fragments were designed to carry a KpnI site that permitted the insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette at the 3 ’ end of upstream fragment and 5 ’ end of downstream fragment with 183 bp deletion of rsmE ORF .
Each fragment was simultaneously cloned into the pEX 18Ap ( Table 1 ) .
A 961 bp fragment containing kanamycin resistance cassette was PCR amplified from pUC4K ( Table 1 ) using the primers , KmKpnF / KmKpnR , and inserted into KpnI site between upstream and downstream fragments in pEX 18Ap .
The resulting plasmid , pEX 18Ap - rsmEKO ( Table 1 ) , was electroporated into P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 , and mutant was selected for by amending LB plates with the appropriate antibiotics .
A KmR , Pips , and SucroseR colony was chosen and the rsmE mutation was verified by PCR and sequencing .
Construction of translational fusion vector with 90 - bp deletion of the 5 ’ - UTR of phenazine biosynthetic operon : To determine the function of the 5 ’ - UTR on translation of the phenazine biosynthesis genes , translation fusion vectors were created containing the sequence from the phenazine biosynthetic operon promoter to the 20th codon of PhzX with or without 90 - bp sequence of 5 ’ - UTR of phenazine biosynthetic operon ( Fig 4B ) .
The fragments with the 90 - bp sequence ( 299 bp ) and without the 90 - bp sequence ( 209 bp ) were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 and pUC 57 - Enh , respectively , using primer set phzXF 1 / phzXR 3 ( S1 Table ) .
The products were cloned , in frame , with the 8th codon of lacZ in the translational fusion vector , pME 6015 [ 34 , 45 ] , resulting pJMYX 7 and pJMYX 8 respectively ( Fig 4B and Table 1 ) .
These plasmids were introduced in the wild - type , 30 - 84W and 30 - 84RsmE via electroporation , and translational activities were determined by β - galactosidase activity .
RNA preparation for quantitative PCR : To isolate RNA from the wild - type and 30 - 84Enh , single colonies of each strain were grown with rapid agitation at 28 ° C in 3 ml of AB - C broth .
When cell density reached OD 620 = 1.8 , 1 ml aliquots of each sample were mixed with 2 ml of Qiagen RNA Protect reagent ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) to stabilize bacterial RNA , and cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2400 x g .
Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s recommended protocol .
The genomic DNA was removed using on - column DNase - I digestion ( Qiagen ) .
Five micrograms of total RNA were reverse - transcribed using random primers ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) and Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) at 50 ° C for 1 h and inactivated at 75 ° C for 15 min .
For the negative control , the same reaction was performed using sterilized water instead of reverse transcriptase .
SYBR Green reactions were performed using the ABI 7900 HT Fast System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) in 384 well optical reaction plates .
Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) assays were performed to measure the expression levels of the target genes as previously described [45] .
Briefly , aliquots ( 1 μ l ) of cDNA ( 2 ng / reaction ) or negative controls were used as template for qPCR reactions with Fast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) and primers ( 500 nM final concentration ) .
qPCR amplifications were carried out at 50 ° C for 2 min , 95 ° C for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 ° C for 15 sec and 60 ° C for 1 min , and a final dissociation curve analysis step from 65 ° C to 95 ° C .
Technical replicate experiments were performed for each of the biological samples , in triplicate .
Amplification specificity for each reaction was confirmed by the dissociation curve analysis .
The Ct values were used for further Δ Δ Ct analysis .
The 16S rDNA was used as a reference gene to normalize samples .
A relative quantification value was calculated for each gene with the control group as a reference [ 27 , 40 , 45 ] .
Quantification of phenazine and AHL production : P . chlororaphis 30 - 84 strains were grown at 28 ° C in AB minimal , LB and PPMD broth with rapid agitation .
Phenazines were extracted from cell - free supernatants as described previously [ 1 , 16 , 45 ] .
Phenazines concentration was calculated via serial dilution of the extract at absorbance of 367 nm .
Total AHLs were extracted as described previously [ 39 , 45 ] from 5 ml cultures , which were grown at 28 ° C with shaking in AB minimal , LB and PPMD broth .
AHL production was quantified by inoculating the extracted AHLs with the AHL - specific reporter strain 30 - 84I / Z ( phzI - , phzB : : lacZ ) .
30 - 84I / Z is deficient in AHL production due to mutation of AHL synthase gene phzI , but responds to AHL by expressing the reporter gene lacZ .
β - galactosidase activity was determined on cultures grown at 28 ° C for 24 h with rapid agitation .
Construction of phzR transcriptional reporters : In order to determine whether the 90 - bp of the 5 ’ - UTR of phenazine biosynthetic operon also negatively influence phzR expression , phzR transcriptional fusions were constructed .
PCR fragments containing a sequence from - 359 bp to + 155 of phzR was amplified from genomic DNA of the wild - type and 30 - 84Enh using the primers , phzRF - phzRR ( S1 Table ) .
The 514 bp and 424 bp PCR amplicons containing phzR promoter region with or without the 90 - bp of the 5 ’ - UTR of phzX , respectively , were ligated into promoter trap vector pGT 2 - lacZ to make the phzR transcriptional fusion vectors , pJMYR 1 and pJMYR 2 ( Table 1 and S4 Fig ) .
These reporters were separately introduced into 30 - 84Ice by triparental mating , and transcriptional activities were determined by β - galactosidase activity .
Microtiter plate biofilm assay and eDNA quantification : To measure the ability of strains 30 - 84 wild - type and 30 - 84Enh to form a biofilm , static biofilm assays were conducted in 24 - well polystyrene microtiter plates .
Briefly , overnight cultures grown in 3 different media ( AB - C , LB and PPMD ) were adjusted to an OD 620 of 0.8 with fresh medium .
The adjusted cultures were diluted 1 : 100 into the appropriate media , and 1.5 ml of the dilution inoculate was transferred into 24 - well plates .
Plates were incubated at 28 ° C without shaking .
After 48 h , the adherent cell population was quantified by crystal violet staining as described previously [ 17 , 67 ] .
The concentration of eDNA was determined quantitatively using Qubit 2.0 Fulorometer ( Invitrogen ) , as described previously with few modification [19] .
Briefly , overnight cultures grown in AB - C broth at 28 ° C with agitation were adjusted to an OD 620 of 0.8 .
The adjusted cultures were re - inoculated at a 1 : 100 dilution into 20 ml AB - C broth .
Cultures were grown at 28 ° C with rapid agitation and sampled every 8 - 12 h .
Cell - free supernatant by centrifugation and filtration were mixed with double - strand DNA fluorescent dyes ( dsDNA BR ) from Qubit ( Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) , and the concentration of eDNA was quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer ( Invitrogen Life Technologies ) .
The amount of eDNA was reported as μ g / ml .
To determine the ability of colonizing to the host plant , the wild - type and 30 - 84Enh were inoculated to wheat ( cultivar TAM 112 ) by two different methods .
For the root - dip inoculation methods , bacterial cultures were grown in 10 ml KMB broth for 24 h , and inoculum was standardized to OD 620 = 0.8 ( ca . 2 x 109 ) in sterile 1X PBS .
Seeds were surface sterilized as previously described [44] , and surface sterilized seeds were pregerminated on sterilized germination paper for two days .
Seedling roots were dipped into the bacterial solution for 10 min , and sown into 25 × 200 mm cone - tainers that contain a natural wheat rhizosphere ( Uvalde , TX ) soil mix ( soil : sand , 2 : 1 , v : v ) .
Plants were grown for 30 days before the entire root system was processed for the CFU calculation , as described previously [44] .
For the soil inoculation method , bacterial cultures were prepared as described above .
Bacteria cultures were washed 3 times with sterilized water , and inoculum were thoroughly mixed with natural wheat rhizosphere soil mix ( soil : sand , 2 : 1 , v : v ) for final bacterial population of 106 CFU / g of soil .
Pregerminated wheat seedlings ( two days ) were sown into the bacterial amended soil mix and were grown for 24 days .
Bacterial populations were collected from the entire root system and quantified by CFU .
Total populations were determined by serial dilution on LB agar amended with rifampicin .
Fungal inhibition and take - all suppression assay : To quantify the ability of strains 30 - 84 wild - type and 30 - 84Enh to inhibit the take - all causal agent Ggt strain ARS - A1 , an in vitro dual culture assay was conducted as described previously [45] .
After 7 days of co - culture on potato dextrose agar plates , the zone of inhibition was measured as the distance between edge of the bacterial colony and the fungal mycelium .
Assays to determine the ability of strains 30 - 84 wild - type and 30 - 84Enh to suppress take - all disease on wheat seedlings were conducted as described previously [ 1 , 51 ] .
Briefly , bacteria - coated seeds or control seeds ( coated with methyl cellulose ) were sown in tubes ( 25 × 200 mm ) filled with 5g of sterilized vermiculate layer overlaid with 20 g of a natural wheat rhizosphere soil mix ( soil : sand , 2 : 1 , v : v ) amended with Ggt colonized oat kernels fragments ( 0.85 % , w / w ) .
For the control , sterilized oat kernels were ground and amended to the soil mix with same amount ( 0.85 % , w / w ) .
Seeds ( cv . TAM 112 ) were covered with 1cm of sterilized vermiculate and incubated for 3 days at room temperature to facilitate germination .
Seedlings were arranged in a complete randomized block design , and transferred to a growth chamber ( 16 ° C , 12 h dark - light cycle ) .
After 20 days , root disease was evaluated on a scale of 0 - 5 , where 0 = no disease and 5 = nearly dead . as described previously [1] .
All data presented are mean ± the standard error of the mean ( STE ) from at least two experiments .
Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Fisher ’ s protected Least Significant Difference ( LSD ) test ( P < 0.05 ) or unpaired t - test .
Data were processed with GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) .
This was a multi - centric , double blind placebo - controlled randomised trial conducted in outpatient departments of 8 referral hospitals in India .
Individual institutional ethics committees ' as well as the IndiaClen Institutional Review Board approved the study .
It was designed for equivalence of two modes of therapy with a predefined range of equivalence as an interval from − 5 % to + 5 % .
The trial was registered with the Clinical Trials registry ( NCT 00407394 ) .
The protocol for this trial and supporing CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information ; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1 .
Two - stage screening was done ( verbal followed by standardised screening ) for inclusion and exclusion criteria .
Children aged 2 - 59 months were verbally screened for complaints of cough , rapid respiration , or difficulties in breathing .
Excluded were those with signs of WHO defined severe pneumonia or very severe disease [7] , other conditions requiring antibiotics therapy , clinically recognized congenital heart disease , chronic systemic disorders , hospitalisation in past 2 weeks , use of antibiotics in previous 2 days , measles within the last month , history of penicillin allergy and prior enrolment in the study .
Those who were verbal screening positive and had no exclusion criteria were examined for study entry criteria , which were audible or auscultatory wheeze and WHO defined fast breathing , that is respiratory rate of ≥ 50 per minute ( for age 2 - 11 months ) or ≥ 40 per minute ( for age 12 - 59 months ) [10] .
Those who fulfilled the study entry criteria were given a maximum of three doses of salbutamol ( 400 microgm / dose ) by either a nebuliser or metered dose inhaler and their respiratory rate was reassessed .
If fast breathing persisted above WHO defined age specific cut - offs , a chest radiograph was taken for diagnosing radiological pneumonia , defined as presence of fluids , parenchymal infiltrates or consolidation [10] .
Those with radiological pneumonia were treated according to the standard hospital treatment guidelines .
The rest were invited to participate in the study .
Those who accepted the invitation were requested to provide informed written parental consent in local language .
Local languages used were site specific and were Hindi for Lucknow , Delhi and Chandigarh sites , Marathi for Nagpur and Mumbai sites , Tamil for Chennai and Vellore site and Malayali for Trivandrum site .
Children of parents consenting for participation were randomised to receive amoxycillin or placebo and continued with oral salbutamol .
Coordinating centre ensured standardised training and quality assurance .
All the participants were followed up on day - 4 and between days 11 - 14 days .
Home visits were done within 24 hours for those who failed to report on the appointed days .
Children who failed on therapy , developed adverse reactions or withdrew consent were treated according to standard hospital guidelines .
Participants received either amoxycillin , 31 - 54 mg / Kg / day , in three divided doses , or placebo , which looked and tasted similar to amoxycillin , in three divided doses orally .
In addition all participants also received oral salbutamol , 2.5 ml or 5 ml thrice a day for ages 2 - 11 months and 12 - 59 months , respectively ( each 5 ml = 2 mg salbutamol ) .
Patients with fever also received paracetemol ( 10 - 15 mg / kg / dose ) in addition to the study intervention .
The primary objective was to compare the proportions of eligible cases that achieve clinical cure on day - 4 on three - days of treatment with either oral amoxycillin or placebo .
Our secondary objective was to compare the proportions that clinically relapsed within the next 11 - 14 days , as well as identify the determinants , if any , of clinical failure .
Secondary laboratory outcome was the proportions positive for respiratory syncycial virus ( RSV ) in nasopharyngeal aspirate at enrolment .
Main outcome measure was clinical cure on day - 4 , defined as those who were not assessed to have clinical failure .
Clinical failure was defined as either ( i ) development of WHO - defined severe pneumonia or very severe disease ( with or without wheeze ) before or on day - 4 assessment , or ( ii ) oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry < 90 % before or on day - 4 assessment or ( iii ) axillary temperature > 101 degrees F on day - 4 assessment , or ( iv ) persistence of WHO - defined non - severe pneumonia on day - 4 assessment , or ( v ) presence of wheeze on day - 4 assessment .
Loss to follow up on day - 4 or withdrawal from the study at any time after recruitment was also considered as therapy failure in the intention - to - treatment ( ITT ) analysis .
Clinical relapse was defined as cases , which were clinically cured on day - 4 assessment , but at days - 11 - 14 follow - up showed signs of WHO - defined pneumonia .
This was calculated for therapeutic equivalence of two treatments ( placebo and amoxycillin ) .
It was assumed that the overall failure rate would be 17 % if the treatments were equivalent [5] .
We used δ = 0.05 to be the range of equivalence for the difference in failure rates .
To detect this difference using Type I error probability ( alpha ) of 0.05 and power of 0.9 , the required size of each treatment group was 970 .
A professional not associated with clinical care ( GGA ) generated the randomization scheme at Lucknow .
Randomised block sizes of two to four were used to avoid any uneven distribution of patients between two interventions .
Unlabelled medicines were placed in serially numbered opaque envelopes by the pharmacy .
Doses were provided for a maximum weight of 20 Kg .
Extra doses were kept for administration to a child who vomited within 30 minutes of dosing .
Health care workers , patients as well as research staff and investigators were blinded .
Adherence was assessed by pill count on day - 4 follow - up .
Non - adherence was defined as intake of less than 7 doses .
A chest radiograph was taken prior to randomisation .
Nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested at enrolment for RSV using DirectogenR kit ( manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company , Sparks MD 21152 , USA ) .
Primary analyses were done on ITT basis .
Per protocol analysis was also done on subjects with complete follow - up and adherence to treatment .
We have used the two one - sided tests ( TOST ) procedure as well as the confidence interval approach for assessing therapeutic equivalence of two treatments [11] .
Baseline and other characteristics were compared between the two regimens .
Association of clinical failure with different characteristics of patients was assessed .
Chi - squared test was used for testing two - sided hypotheses , whereas Z - test was used to test one - sided hypotheses .
A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
Crude odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were computed .
The covariates , which were found to be significant or nearly significant ( p ≤ 0.10 ) in univariate analysis , were included to construct a multivariate model for assessing determinants of treatment failure by forward stepwise logistic regression .
In the later model , we also investigated the possibility of variables acting as effect modifier for the risk factors .
Final model included covariates that were statistically significant .
The primary outcome measure was also assessed for each site and the overall odds ratio after stratifying for site was obtained .
Mantel - Haenszel statistic for testing independence of clinical failure with interventions , adjusting for site was used .
Breslow - Day statistic for testing three - factor interaction of clinical failure , interventions and site was used .
Data were analyzed using statistical software “ Statistical Package for Social Sciences ” ( SPSS ) 11.0 version .
Constructing a demographic model to explore the process of colony failure : the hypothesis : We hypothesise that colony failure occurs when the death rate of bees in the colony is unsustainable .
At this point normal social dynamics break down , it becomes impossible for the colony to maintain a viable population , and the colony will fail .
We hypothesise that any factor that causes an elevated forager death rate will reduce the strength of social inhibition , resulting in a precocious onset of foraging behaviour in young bees [5] .
Because foraging is high - risk [2] , precocious foraging shortens overall bee lifespan .
Precocious foragers are also less effective and weaker than foragers that have made the behavioural transition at the normal age [25] , [26] .
Consequently , as the mean age of the foraging force decreases forager death rates increase further , which accelerates the population decline .
A precocious onset of foraging reduces the population of hive bees engaged in brood care .
This reduces colony brood rearing capacity , and the population crashes .
A similar hypothesis has been proposed to explain the impact of Nosema ceranae on colonies [15] , but we argue this hypothesis is applicable to any factor that chronically elevates forager bee death rates .
We explore this hypothesis using the following simple mathematical model .
A mathematical model allows us to explore the effects of different factors and forces on the population of the hive in a quantitative way .
Such a model has the potential to make predictions for the outcome of various manipulations , and to allow a preliminary exploration of the problem before investing in experimental work .
We construct a simple compartment model for the worker bee population of the hive ( Fig . 1 ) .
Our model only considers the population of female workers since males ( drones ) do not contribute to colony work .
Let H be the number of bees working in the hive and F the number of bees who work outside the hive , referred to here as foragers .
We assume that all adult worker bees can be classed either as hive bees or as foragers , and that there is no overlap between these two behavioural classes [1] , [4] .
Hence the total number of adult worker bees in the colony is N = H + F .

Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0018491.g001 Elements of honey bee social dynamics considered by our model .
Eggs laid by the queen are reared as brood that eclose three weeks later as adult bees .
Adult bees work in the hive initially before becoming foragers .
Our model considers the death rate of adult bees within the hive to be negligible , but forager death rate is a parameter varied in our simulations .
We assume the amount of brood reared is influenced by the size of the colony ( number of hive and forager bees ) and that the rate at which bees transition from hive bees to forager bees is influenced by the number of foragers to represent the effect of social inhibition .
Our model does not consider the impact of brood diseases on colony failure , however we believe our approach is still useful because many cases of colony failure and CCD are not caused by brood diseases [21] , [22] , [23] .
Hive bees eclose from pupae and mature into foragers .
Death rates of adult hive bees in a healthy colony are extremely low as the environment is protected and stable .
We assume that the death rate of hive bees is negligible .
Workers are recruited to the forager class from the hive bee class and die at a rate m .
Let t be the time measured in days .
Then we can represent this process as a differential equation model : ( 1 )
( 2 ) The function E ( H , F ) describes the way that eclosion depends on the number of hive bees and foragers .
The recruitment rate function R ( H , F ) models the effect of social inhibition on the recruitment rate .
It is known that the number of eggs reared in a colony ( and hence the eclosion rate ) is related to the number of bees in the hive .
Big colonies raise more brood [27] , [28] , [29] .
The nature of this dependence is not known , however .
We assume that the maximum rate of eclosion is equivalent to the queen ' s laying rate L and that the eclosion rate approaches this maximum as N ( the number of workers in the hive ) increases .
In the absence of other information we use the simplest function that increases from zero for no workers and tends to L as N becomes very large :
( 3 ) Here w determines the rate at which E ( H , F ) approaches L as N gets large .
Figure 2 shows E ( H , F ) as a function of N for a range of values of w .

We write the recruitment function as ( 4 ) The first term represents the maximum rate that hive bees will become foragers when there are no foragers present in the colony .
The second term represents social inhibition and , in particular , how the presence of foragers reduces the rate of recruitment of hive bees to foragers .
We have assumed that social inhibition is directly proportional to the fraction of the total number of adult bees that are foragers , such that a high fraction of foragers in the hive results in low recruitment .
In the absence of any foragers new workers will become foragers at a minimum of four days after eclosing [30] , so an appropriate choice for the rate of uninhibited transition to foraging is = 0.25 .
We chose = 0.75 since this factor implies that a reversion of foragers to hive bees would only occur if more than one third of the hive are foragers .
We also chose L = 2000 as the daily laying rate of the queen [31] and w = 27,000 .
The equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with the functions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) were analysed using standard linear stability analysis and phase plane analysis [32] .
The model has a globally stable steady state ( H0 , F0 ) where ( 5 ) when ( 6 ) Otherwise the state with no adult bees is an attractor and the hive population goes to zero .
Figure 3 shows phase plane solutions for a low death rate , m = 0.24 , when the populations tend to a positive steady state , and a higher death rate m = 0.40 , when the population goes extinct .
In each case the solution rapidly approaches the line F = JH so that the ratio of hive bee numbers to forager numbers is close to being constant .
The population size adjusts more slowly to either a positive steady state or to zero .
Figure 4 shows the decline of a doomed population as a function of time ( dotted line ) .
If the foragers become less able and more likely to die as they get younger then the decline will be more rapid ( solid line ) .

This plot shows the time course of colony decline when all foragers perform equally well ( dashed line ) and when precocious foragers die faster than mature foragers ( solid line ) .
The effect of precocious foraging is modeled by replacing the death rate m by m = ml R 2 / ( 2 + R 2 ) whenever R < 0 where R is the recruitment rate of foragers given in eqn ( 4 ) .
Parameter values are L = 2000 , = 0.25 , = .75 , w = 27 000 , ml = 0.6 and 2 = 0.059 .
Figure 5 is a bifurcation diagram , which shows that for low values of the forager death rate m there are large numbers of bees in the colony , but once m passes a critical value the colony population cannot support itself and the colony fails .

Parameter values are the same as Figure 3 .

Parameter values are the same as Figure 3 .
We compared results from the model to experimental observations of Rueppell et al [33] .
We used the observed flightspan [ the number of days bees were observed foraging 33 ] , to estimate the death rate of foragers since m is the reciprocal of flightspan .
With these values of m we used the model to calculate the average age of onset of foraging ( AAOF ) and the lifespan of worker bees for each colony and compared these model values to observed results .
These observed and calculated results are shown in Table 1 .
Even with the somewhat rough estimates of parameters , the model matches the observational data well for average age at onset of foraging , although it is slightly high for worker lifespan .
Nevertheless , given that the model is a very simple representation of honey bee demographics , the results are encouraging .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0018491.t001 Comparison of experimental data and model results for average age of onset of foraging ( AAOF ) and lifespan .
Experimental data is from Rueppell et al [33] and model results were obtained by running the model for 40 days ( approximately the observational period used by Rueppell et al ) .
At the start of each model run H = 9000 for large colonies and 4500 for small colonies and F = 0 .
The parameters were L = 2000 , w = 27000 , = 0.25 and = 0.75 .
Experiments were performed on adult male Swiss mice ( 3 - to 5 - month - old ; 28 - 35 g ) obtained from an authorized supplier ( Animal House of the University of Granada , Granada , Spain ) .
Mice were kept on a 12 - h light / dark cycle with constant ambient temperature ( 21 ± 1 ° C ) and humidity ( 50 ± 7 % ) .
Food and water were available ad libitum .
Electrophysiological and behavioral studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Union Council ( 2003 / 65 / CE ) and Spanish regulations ( BOE 252 / 34367 - 91 , 2005 ) for the use of laboratory animals in chronic experiments .
Experiments were also approved by the institutional committee for animal care and handling ( Vicerrectorate of Research / Ethic Committee Code 13 / 01 / 11 ) .
The experimental animals were assigned to the following groups : ( i ) animals having stimulation in the reuniens nucleus and fEPSP recordings in the prefrontal cortex ( n = 20 ) ; these animals were classically conditioned with a trace paradigm in the presence ( n = 10 ) or absence ( n = 10 ) of two HFS sessions ; ( ii ) animals stimulated in the reuniens nucleus and with fEPSP recordings carried in the hippocampal CA 1 layer ( n = 20 ) ; half of these animals were presented with two HFS sessions before the first two conditioning sessions ; ( iii ) mice ( n = 20 ) presented with an object discrimination test in the presence ( n = 10 ) or absence ( n = 10 ) of an HFS stimulation session ; ( iv ) animals ( n = 10 ) presented with two HFS sessions , and the fEPSPs evoked by pairs of pulses ( 40 ms of interval ) in the PFC and in the CA 1 were followed for up to 3 d ; and ( v ) ten additional animals used for the histological study .
Once anesthetized ( ketamine , 35 mg / kg and xylazine , 2 mg / kg , i.p . ) , mice were placed in a multi - arm stereotaxic frame .
Body temperature was maintained at 37 ° C with a water blanket .
A pair of stimulating electrodes was implanted stereotactically in the right reuniens nucleus ( − 0.82 mm posterior , + 0.2 mm lateral , and − 4.5 mm below bregma [54] ) .
These bipolar stimulating electrodes were made from 50 μ m , tungsten Teflon - coated wire ( A - M Systems , Carlsborg , WA ) .
Separation between tips was < 1.0 mm , with the cathodic tip ∼ 0.5 mm ventral to the anodic one .
For experiments included in groups ( i ) and ( ii ) , animals were also implanted with a recording electrode aimed at the right mPFC ( + 1.94 mm anterior , + 0.25 mm lateral , and − 3.12 mm below bregma ) for half of the animals or at the right CA 1 layer of the hippocampus ( − 3.16 mm posterior , + 3.2 mm lateral , and − 2 mm below bregma ) for the other half .
The mPFC and CA 1 recording electrodes were made from a single Teflon - coated tungsten wire ( A - M Systems ) .
The final depths of stimulating and recording electrodes were adjusted to achieve a maximal fEPSP response [2] , [5] .
In the same surgical step , animals included in groups ( i ) and ( ii ) were implanted with four electrodes in the upper eyelid of the left eye .
Electrodes were also made from 50 μ m , Teflon - coated , annealed stainless steel wire ( A - M Systems ) , with their tips bared of the isolating cover for 0.5 mm and bent as a hook .
Two of the electrodes were aimed at the supraorbital nerve , and served for the application of electrical stimuli .
The second electrode pair was implanted in the ipsilateral orbicularis oculi muscle and served for recording its EMG activity .
Another electrode was soldered to a screw and fixed in the skull , serving as ground .
The eight electrodes were soldered to two 4 - pin sockets ( RS - Amidata , Madrid , Spain ) and the whole assembly was fixed with dental cement to the cranial bone .
After surgery , animals were kept in independent cages , with free access to food and water , for the rest of the experiment .
Experiments were started one week after surgery .
The EMG activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle was recorded with Grass P511 differential amplifiers ( Grass - Telefactor , West Warwick , RI , USA ) at a bandwidth of 0.1 Hz - 10 kHz .
Field EPSP recordings were also made with Grass P511 differential amplifiers through a high - impedance probe ( 2 × 1012 Ω , 10 pF ) .
For input / output curves , animals were stimulated in the reuniens nucleus with paired pulses ( 40 ms of interstimulus interval ) at increasing intensities ( 0.1 - 1.8 mA ) .
The effects of paired pulses at different ( 20 , 40 , 100 , 200 , and 500 ms ) interstimulus intervals were also checked .
In this case , we used intensities corresponding to 35 - 50 % of the amount necessary to evoke a saturating response [25] .
To avoid any cumulative effect , intensities and intervals were presented at random .
For the range of intensities used here , population spikes were observed rarely in the collected recordings .
For LTP induction , each animal was presented with one or two HFS sessions .
An HFS session consisted of five 200 Hz , 100 ms trains of pulses at a rate of 1 / s .
This protocol was presented six times , at intervals of 1 min .
Thus , a total of 600 pulses were presented during the HFS session .
Unless otherwise indicated , and in order to avoid evoking large population spikes and / or the appearance of EEG seizures , the stimulus intensity during HFS was set at the amount necessary to evoke about 1 / 3 of the maximum fEPSP response ( 0.4 - 0.9 mA ) - that is , well below the threshold for evoking a population spike [2] , [55] .
An additional criterion for selecting stimulus intensity was that a second stimulus , presented 40 ms after a conditioning pulse , evoked a larger ( > 20 % ) synaptic field potential than the first [2] , [56] .
In addition , fEPSP evolution after HFS sessions was checked with pairs of pulses ( 40 ms of interval ) presented to the reuniens nucleus for up to 72 h following the first HFS session .
Conditioning sessions were carried out with two animals at a time .
Animals were placed individually in a small ( 5 × 5 × 10 cm ) plastic chamber located inside a larger ( 30 × 30 × 20 cm ) Faraday box to eliminate electrical interferences .
A trace conditioning paradigm was used .
For this , animals were presented with a tone ( 2400 Hz , 70 dB , 20 ms ) as CS , followed 500 ms later by an electrical stimulation ( 250 μ s , 3 x Threshold , cathodic pulse ) as US .
Pairs of CS - US presentations were separated at random by 30 ± 5 s .
In total , two habituation , 10 conditioning , and three extinction sessions were carried out per animal .
A conditioning session consisted of 60 CS - US presentations , and lasted ∼ 30 min .
In order to determine the complete EMG profile of CRs , in 10 % of the cases the CS was presented alone .
For habituation and extinction sessions , only the CS was presented , also for 60 times per session at intervals of 30 ± 5 s .
As a criterion , we considered a “ CR ” the presence , during the CS - US interval , of EMG activity lasting ∼ 10 ms and initiated ∼ 50 ms after CS onset .
In addition , the integrated EMG activity recorded during the CS - US interval had to be at least 2.5 times greater than the averaged activity recorded immediately before CS presentation [2] , [21] .
Synaptic field potentials in the mPFC or in the hippocampal CA 1 layer were evoked during habituation , conditioning , and extinction sessions by a single 100 is , square , biphasic ( negative - positive ) pulse applied to the reuniens nucleus 250 ms after CS presentation .
Stimulus intensities ranged from 0.4 mA to 0.9 mA .
In the object recognition task , mice were individually habituated to an open field ( 40 × 25 × 15 cm ) , under low - illumination conditions and with no objects , for 5 min .
Mice behavior was videotaped using a digital camera ( Airis N729 , Madrid , Spain ) mounted 1 m above the open field .
During the training session , two unknown but identical objects ( O1 and O2 ) were put into the open field , and the mouse was allowed to explore them freely for 10 min .
The time spent exploring each object and the total approach time ( i.e. , the time spent exploring both objects ) were quantified .
As criterion , object exploration was determined as the time spent by the animal close to the object and touching it with the nose or the vibrissae .
After each trial , the apparatus and the objects were thoroughly cleaned with 70 % ethanol .
One hour after the first training , mice were allowed to explore the open field for another 10 min , when one of the two familiar objects ( O1 or O2 ) was replaced with an identical object ( O3 ) , and the other ( O1 or O2 ) with a novel object ( B1 ) .
The time spent exploring each object and the total approach time were quantified again .
Within each experimental group , the object positions were interchanged between mice to avoid location bias .
After 24 h , mice were tested again , with a new object ( C1 ) and an object identical to the previous one ( B2 ) .
At the end of the behavioral studies , mice were divided in three groups : naive control animal ( without electrode ) , electrode controls ( animals without stimulation ) and stimulated animals ( animals with stimulation ) .
Mice were deeply re - anesthetized ( sodium pentobarbital , 50 mg / kg ) , and perfused transcardially with saline and 4 % phosphate - buffered paraformaldehyde .
Selected sections ( 50 μ m ) including the thalamus , ventral hippocampus , and prefrontal cortex were mounted on gelatinized glass slides and stained using the Nissl technique with 0.1 % cresyl violet .
That allowed us to determine first , the exact location of the stimulating and recording electrodes in the brain ( Fig . 1 ) and second , to verify whether neuronal loss or atrophy occurs in the reuniens nucleus .
Quantification of neuronal density and reuniens nucleus area was carried out using the free Image J Software .
For the sake of homogeneity , only data collected from animals that completed all the required tests were stored and analyzed ( n ≥ 7 per group and task ) .
Data were stored directly on a computer through an analog / digital converter ( CED 1401 Plus , Cambridge , England ) , at a sampling frequency of 11 - 22 kHz and an amplitude resolution of 12 bits .
Data were analyzed off - line for quantification of CRs , fEPSP amplitude , and object recognition times with the help of homemade representation programs [2] , [21] , [23] .
Collected eyelid data were quantified , through a purpose - designed Excel worksheet , as the percentage of CRs per session - namely , the proportion of stimulations within a session of 60 presentations that generated an EMG activity satisfying the above - mentioned criteria .
For fEPSP analysis , five successive evoked field synaptic potentials were averaged , and the mean value of fEPSP amplitude was determined between the lower and upper inflection points of the evoked field potential [2] .
Time expended on each object during the object recognition test was quantified from the collected videos .
Statistical differences between groups were compared across conditioning and extinction sessions using the two - way repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) test , performed with the SPSS 13.0 for Windows package ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL ) .
Unless otherwise indicated , data are represented by the mean ± s.e .m .
Collected data were analyzed using a two - way ANOVA test , with time or session as repeated measure , coupled with contrast analysis when appropriate .
One - way ANOVA allowed checking the statistical differences between different groups .
In all of the cases , the corresponding statistical significance test ( i.e. , F [ ( m - 1 ) , ( m - 1 ) x ( n - 1 ) ] statistic ) were reported where m and n indicate number of groups and number of animals , respectively .
Description of the postoperative nursing simulation : The purpose of this simulation was to allow students to observe postoperative patients and learn to assess patients accurately using available information on them .
The educator informed students that they would see a patient one hour after the patient ’ s tracheal tube had been removed within the operating room .
Students were further instructed to observe the patient ’ s condition and position of the patient ’ s body , and to pay attention to the patient ’ s respiratory condition .
In addition , the students were asked to conduct a medical interview with the manikin .
After explaining this process to the students , the educator was waiting in another room next door .
The educator observed the students through a one - way mirror window in the next room from which the educator could see the students , but the students could not see the educator .
The educator observed students ’ performance on the observation of respiratory condition , which included confirmation of position of the patient ’ s body , oxygen dose , auscultation of respiratory sound , thorax movement , respiratory frequency , respiratory pattern , and respiratory rhythm .
The simulation was progressed into the following phases : 1 ) . introduction ( 5 minutes ; students were given basic information on the patient and setting ) ; 2 ) .
a 5 - minute break ( hereafter , “ the break ” ) ; 3 ) . patient care ( about 10 minutes ; the student examined the manikin through auscultation , inspection , and palpation ) ; 4 ) . reporting ( 5 minutes ; student reported on patient care ) ; and 5 ) . debriefing ( 10 minutes ) .
In the patient care phase , they mainly confirmed the patient ’ s breathing frequency , breathing sound , cyanosis , and peripheral circulation .
In addition , they confirmed that the oxygen tube was not bent and that the dose of oxygen was correct .
The debriefing was conducted in a separate room from the patient ’ s room and was based on the following five guidelines by Decker et al . : ( 1 ) facilitated by an individual competent in the debriefing process ; ( 2 ) conducted in an environment conducive to learning and that supports confidentiality , trust , open communication , self - analysis , and reflection ; ( 3 ) facilitated by a person ( s ) who observed the simulated experience ; ( 4 ) based on a structured framework for debriefing ; and ( 5 ) congruent with the students ’ objectives and outcomes of the simulation - based learning experience [17] .
The educator gave feedback about the patient care phase for students .
The simulation lasted for about 30 minutes from introduction to debriefing ( Table 1 ) .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0195280.t001 Simulation phases .
A high - fidelity manikin was installed within the patient ’ s room .
The temperature , relative humidity , and illumination conditions were controlled .
The patient was simulated using a life - size manikin for advanced life support training ( Laerdal Co . , Ltd ) .
This manikin is capable of issuing ( and attenuating ) a breathing sound and can be set to have specific a heart rate , blood pressure , and respiratory rate in realistic scenarios .
The patient simulated was a 53 - year - old male who had undergone total gastrectomy for the treatment of gastric cancer .
The scenario was set such that the patient ’ s tracheal tube had been removed within the operating room one hour before the student saw him .
The patient had fully recovered consciousness after the operation and was outfitted with a central venous catheter , an oxygen mask with a flow of 3 liters of per minute , a nasogastric tube , a urethral catheter , a sheet of gauze for protection of the celiotomy wound , an indwelling abdominal drain , and an electrocardiogram monitor .
We set the manikin ’ s physiological parameters as follows ( heart rate , 62 - 70 bpm ; blood pressure , 120 - 128 / 66 - 70 mmHg ; and respiratory rate , 16 - 20 min ) .
Third - year students enrolled in a 4 - year nursing university course were recruited as volunteers in this study .
All students had acquired the credits for all lecture - based lessons before participation in the study .
None of the students had used a high - fidelity manikin before .
They had two weeks ’ experience of practicing in a hospital setting before this study , during which they had only taken charge of a single patient .
None of them had begun surgical nursing practice , and all were unfamiliar with the observation of a real surgical patient .
Therefore , a simple and easy - to - resolve scenario was required .
Students with hypertension , heart disease , diabetes mellitus , or kidney disease , or who were receiving routine oral medication , were excluded from this study .
All students were advised to avoid consuming alcohol and caffeine the day before the study and to sleep well on the night before .
Overall , 74 eligible students who provided informed consent for participation and were given an explanation of the ethical considerations enrolled in the study .
Before students entered the patient ’ s room , the researcher connected students to a Holter electrocardiography system ( GLLERT Lab Tech Co . , Ltd . ) and then gave students an explanation of the setting of the simulation .
They were also given a 5 - minute break ( the break phase ) to stabilize their autonomic nervous system .
During the break phase , students were advised to take deep breaths while sitting on the chair in a quiet room with the curtains drawn .
Five minutes later , students entered the patients ’ room with the educator to begin the patient care phase .
This phase ended when the student said “ completed . ” Upon completion of patient care , students reported to the educator what they had observed and assessed with regard to the patient ’ s condition ( the reporting phase ) .
The educator observed the students in a booth connected to the patients ’ room , which was blinded from view while in the patients ’ room .
After being disconnected from the Holter system , the student was interviewed about his / her reflections on the simulation , with emphasis being put on what the student had said of the simulation .
The Holter system records were used to calculate heart rate , as well as the HF and LF / HF components of HRV .
The simulation was divided into five phases , although HRV was only compared between the following four : ( 1 ) break , ( 2 ) patient care , ( 3 ) reporting , and ( 4 ) debriefing .
Significant differences in heart rate and the HRV components were determined using the Mann - Whitney U - test with SPSS Statistics 22 ( IBM Corp . , Armonk , NY ) .
The statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05 .
In addition , we analyzed the meaning of students ’ remarks and counted the number of occurrences of certain remarks .
Each student received an explanation from the researcher about the ethical considerations related to the study , including the freedom of the student to participate in the study at her / his own discretion and to cancel participation at any time after the start of the study , and the fact that participation ( or lack thereof ) would have no influence on the student ’ s school performance .
If students considered these terms acceptable , they were asked to give their written consent .
This study was carried out with the approval of the Research Ethics Committee at Chubu University to which the researcher belonged .
Random sampling was used to select a total of 298 HIV - infected Chinese patients living in four areas with high prevalence of HIV infection ( Shenqiu , Shangcai , Weishi and Queshan counties ) of Henan province for more than six months .
These patients were enrolled in a follow up investigation by the CDC of Henan province from 2004 to 2011 and the participants ’ viral load were regularly monitored once per year and CD 4 + T cell counts were monitored twice a year .
The median study period of the patients is 7.5 years , and the study is ongoing .
The full criteria employed to determine inclusion into the study were : 1 ) the HIV serum positive status of the subject was confirmed by detection of HIV antibody , antigen and HIV nucleic acid according to the published “ National Guidelines for Detection of HIV / AIDS ” or the patient was diagnosed as to having progressed to AIDS ; 2 ) the patient received HAART ; 3 ) the treatment regimens had been recorded ; 4 ) the patient viral load and CD 4 + T cell count was assayed regularly and these records are available from the CDC of Henan province .
Progression to AIDS in adults was diagnosed as any patient in WHO clinical stage 4 or for whom the CD 4 count is less than 200 cells / mm 3 or a CD 4 percentage less than 15 % .
WHO clinical stage 4 is defined as suffering from severe associated diseases such as HIV wasting syndrome , pneumocystis pneumonia , recurrent severe bacterial pneumonia , chronic herpes simplex infection ( orolabial , genital or anorectal of more than one month ’ s duration or visceral at any site ) etc [20] This initial cohort is a pilot program , with the goal of greatly extending the studied population .
This study is approved by the Henan Province Health Department and all participants provided written informed consent .
Information on study participants ’ personal characteristics , treatment regiment , and medical history was collected using a questionnaire .
Whole blood samples from participants were obtained by the local CDC .
After erythrocyte lysis , white blood cells were separated and stored immediately at − 80 ° C .
Genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit ( Promega , Madison , WI ) following manufacturer ’ s instructions .
The DNA was quantified with UV - vis spectrophotometer ( NanoDropND - 1000 ) and then diluted to working concentrations of 25 ng / μ L .
Five SNPs : CYP2B 6 516G > T ( rs 3745274 ) , ABCB 1 3435T > A / C / G ( rs 1045642 ) , ABCB 1 2677T > G / A ( rs 2032582 ) , ABCG 2 421C > A ( rs 2231142 ) , ABCC 4 559G > T ( rs 11568658 ) were selected based on a literature review [19] , [21] - [23] .
The genotypes of all samples were determined by a high - throughput PCR - sequencing approach .
The primers for PCR amplification and sequencing are listed in Table S1 ; the sequencing primer is the same as forward PCR primer .
The genomic DNA samples were amplified using Premix ExTaq ( 2 × , TaKaRa ) in 96 - well PCR plates ( Axygen ) with 25 μ L of each PCR mixture composed of 12.5 μ L Premix ExTaq ( 2 × , TaKaRa ) , 1 μ L genomic DNA ( 25 ng / μ L ) , 1 μ L of each primer ( 10 μ M ) and 9.5 μ L ultra - pure water .
The reaction was initially denatured at 95 ° C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95 ° C for 30 seconds , 58 ° C for 30 seconds and 72 ° C for 30 seconds extension and completed by a final extension at 72 ° C for 10 minutes on Lifepro Thermal Cycler ( Bioer ) .
PCR products were purified according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( GenMag Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . ) .
The purified PCR products were sequenced using MegaBace 1000 ( GE Healthcare ) .
Logistic regression models were used to estimate P - value , odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) for the ability of these genotypes to predict therapeutic response when a binary outcome measurement was used , and linear regression for the measurements using continuous values .
CD 4 + T cell counts were assessed twice per year from 2004 until 2011 .
In consultation with local physicians as to how CD 4 + T cell counts is used to evaluate response to the aggressive early treatment strategy employed with these patients , the following scale was used : 0 : CD 4 + T cell counts were less than 250 / mm 3 at the final measurement ; 1 : counts consistently greater than 250 / mm 3 from the initial to final measurement ; 2 : counts improved from less than 250 / mm 3 in the initial measurement to greater than 250 / mm 3 in the final measurements .
This was further simplified to a binary assessment of “ no change ” ( 0 or 1 ) and “ improved ” ( 2 ) .
These scales were determined prior to analysis .
Genotype associations were assessed as additive , recessive , and dominant models .
As there were two SNPs for ABCB 1 , these were also assessed using a simple additive model .
To determine independence of the alleles of other factors , namely age , sex and progression to AIDS , multivariate logistic regression modeling was employed .
All results were considered significant if the P - value was less than 0.05 .
All P - values were 2 - sided .
Prior to study the cohort was randomly partitioned into a discovery ( n = 215 ; subset with CD 4 response data , n = 197 ) and validation ( n = 83 ; subset with CD 4 response data , n = 78 ) subsets , the validation subset was not used in the initial discovery analyses .
The splitting of the cohort into discovery and validation cohorts was not employed when exploring association with specific treatments .
Because the patient counts per genotype in the different treatment regimens was low for some subgroups a Fisher exact test was used to assess the distribution of patients in these analyses .
The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software ( version 19.0 ; IBM Corp , New York ) .
Inclusion criteria for our review were : ( 1 ) longitudinal measurement of the course of depression ( 2 ) providing absolute numbers or percentages of recurrence a ) diagnosis established with an interview based on state - of the - art depression criteria ( e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , DSM - III / III - R / DSM - IV ) [12] - [14] or b ) with standardized questionnaires that assess depressive symptoms ( e.g. , Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology , IDS ) [15] or - , Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression , HRSD ) [16] ( 3 ) with a follow - up of at least six months ( 4 ) in which data were collected for patients with and without a certain co - morbid chronic somatic illness at the same measurement intervals a ) where co - morbid chronic somatic illnesses were assessed either via self - report or b ) medical records or c ) by a diagnosis of a medical professional .
There is great overlap between self - report of somatic illnesses and diagnoses of these illnesses [17] , therefore studies that used self - report as a measurement tool were included as well .
If treatment effects were studied within a randomized controlled trial without a treatment - as - usual group , these were excluded .
We also excluded studies on bipolar disorders .
All relevant publications in English , Dutch , Spanish , Polish or German were taken into account .
To assess eligibility of articles , one reviewer ( GK ) made the first selection based on titles .
In case of doubt abstracts or full text articles were retrieved for closer reading .
Thereafter , two independent reviewers made a selection based on abstracts ( GK and WH ) ; further winnowing was performed by two reviewers ( GK and CB ) based on full text articles .
In case of inconsistencies , articles were evaluated again until consensus was reached .
The kappa statistic for inter - observer variability was reported for the abstract and full - text selection .
In line with the APA [6] and NICE [4] , [5] treatment guidelines we limited the search to chronic somatic illnesses .
The chronic somatic illnesses chosen for this systematic review were : heart diseases , gastrointestinal diseases , diabetes mellitus , rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) and neoplasms .
The choice of these chronic somatic illnesses was based on them being mentioned in the clinical practice guidelines of the APA [6] and NICE [4] and their high prevalence rates brought up in additional literature [18] , [19] .
A combination of MeSH - terms and free text words was entered into the search engines PubMed , EMbase and PsycINFO .
These were all screened for relevant articles through 4 December 2012 .
The terms ‘ depression or depressive disorder or major depression were combined with heart diseases or gastrointestinal diseases or diabetes mellitus or arthritis , rheumatoid or asthma or HIV or neoplasms and incidence or follow - up studies or prognos * or predict * or course or outcome or relaps * or recur * or remis * or epidemiology .
The key words regarding depression outcomes were based on Altman [20] ( box 2 ) and modified by adding relaps * , recur * and remis * to fit our research purpose .
Since not all studies might explicitly mention recurrence , even though they studied the impact on for example chronicity , including recurrence , we decided on the above mentioned broad search terms .
Additionally , reference lists from included articles , earlier reviews and NICE [4] , [5] and APA [6] clinical treatment guidelines were screened for other potentially eligible papers and experts were consulted to identify additional important papers .
The following data were extracted from the included articles : study site , number of participants , their age and gender distribution , information about depression assessment ( method and measurement intervals ) , characteristics of the chronic somatic illnesses ( type and assessment method ) and the outcome measure ( recurrence ) .
Outcomes consisted of the differences in percentages or mean numbers of recurrence during follow - up , if applicable for multiple time intervals , between patients with and without co - morbid chronic somatic illness .
Risk ratios ( RR ) and 95 % Confidence Intervals ( CI ) were calculated by using Review Manager 5.1 .
To allow for judgments on the quality of the included articles regarding their selection process , design , analyses and outcome measures , a modified version of the Newcastle - Ottowa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies was used [21] .
This instrument was reviewed by Deeks et al . [22] and described as one of the most usable methods for this type of study [22] , [23] .
All articles were judged by two reviewers ( GK and WH ) .
If information on a quality criterion was not mentioned explicitly in the article , we assigned a question mark .
Using the Twitter application programming interface [44] , we retrieved , depending on the date , 1 % to 15 % of public tweets from 19 November 2009 , the first day that tweet coordinates were provided , to 20 December 2012 .
Due to data collection issues , there were missing days in the collection period but only days that were complete were considered in the data analysis , resulting in 839 days analysed .
The dataset was then filtered for conversational tweets ( replies ) posted from the United Kingdom .
The list of tweet IDs analysed in this paper was deposited on figshare ( http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1249692 ) The message of each filtered tweet was extracted by removing all leading @ usernames , and leading and trailing whitespaces of the remaining text .
Leading whitespaces were not removed when the message length was measured in terms of the available space because some tweets do not use whitespaces to separate the @ usernames with the message .
Messages with a length , in characters , of zero or greater than 140 ( maximum allowed length of tweets ) were then discarded resulting in a total of 3,443,773 tweets posted by 372,783 users , suitable for analysis by region .
The length of messages in words was determined by calculating the number of chunks after splitting the message by whitespaces .
The posting location of a tweet was determined by using its geo , coordinates and place metadata ( geotags ) , where these fields were considered in this order .
Tweets were then assigned to individual districts based on boundary data provided by the UK Ordnance Survey .
Tweets that only have place information were considered to be from UK if the country attribute of place was United Kingdom .
The centroid of the bounding _ box attribute , if it existed , were then used to determine the districts .
Otherwise , the tweet was assigned to the name of the place if the place _ type was city or admin .
A tweet with no coordinates and only England as its place was excluded because the location information was too coarse to determine if it came from Northern England , Southern England or the Midlands .
Note that Twitter users must opt - in to have their location information included in their tweet metadata .
Participants were drawn from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ( ARIC ) study , a large , ongoing , prospective cohort study designed to investigate the etiology of atherosclerosis and disease outcomes of adults residing in four U.S . communities : Baltimore , Maryland ; Minneapolis , Minnesota ; Jackson , Mississippi ; and Winston - Salem , North Carolina .
Approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45 - 64 years old were enrolled at each ARIC site between 1987 and 1989 [11,12] .
All participants signed an informed consent document .
Baseline de - identified ARIC data from 14,812 participants with and without T2DM were obtained from BioLINCC ( https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/ ) [13] .
The current secondary data analysis was approved by the Augusta University ( formerly Medical College of Georgia ) Institutional Review Board .
T2DM was the outcome variable , defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria [14] by one or more the following : fasting blood glucose ≥ 126mg / dL , non - fasting blood glucose ≥ 200 mg / dL , self - reported diabetes diagnosis , or taking diabetes medications .
Diabetes status and anthropometric data were collected with each study visit .
The following seven anthropometric measures were included in our analysis : a body shape index [ ABSI = waist circumference ( cm ) / ( BMI 0.66 x height ( m ) 0.5 ) ] , body adiposity index [ BAI = hip circumference ( cm ) / ( ( height ( m ) 1.5 ) - 18 ) ] , body mass index [ BMI = body weight ( kg ) / height ( m2 ) ] , waist circumference [ WC , cm ] , waist to hip ratio [ WHR = waist circumference ( cm ) / hip circumference ( cm ) ] , waist to height ratio [ WHtR = waist circumference ( cm ) / height ( cm ) ] , and waist to hip to height ratio [ WHHR = WC ( cm ) / ( hip circumference ( cm ) / height ( cm ) ) ] .
These variables were calculated from body weight , height , WC , and hip circumference measured in the fasted state , in light clothing without shoes , by trained ARIC technicians .
WC was measured using an anthropometric tape at the level of the umbilicus with the participant standing [15] .
Hip circumference was measured at the maximal protrusion of the buttocks .
Race identification and gender were self - reported .
Age ( continuous ) was the only variable considered for covariate adjustment .
We tested the inclusion of variables for cigarette smoking ( current , former , never ( yes / no ) ) and alcohol intake ( g / day ) in the models .
However , these variables did not appreciably decrease the Akaike Information Criteria ( AIC ) of their respective models , and therefore were excluded from the final analysis .
Physical activity using the sports domain of the Baecke questionnaire responses [16] collected at visits one and three only , and highest education level completed ( < high school , high school graduate to some college or vocational school graduate , and ≥ college graduate ) , collected at visit one only were used to describe the sample population at baseline , but were not included in the final analysis because they were not collected at all four study visits .
Other participant characteristics used to describe the sample population at baseline , but not included in the final analysis were fasting blood glucose , total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and use of blood pressure medications ( yes / no ) .
Time to development of T2DM ( cases ) and survival time for non - cases were used in analyses .
Participants were excluded from analysis if they had diabetes at baseline ( n = 1808 ) , if they were missing baseline data for anthropometric measures ( n = 14 ) , or did not return for any follow - up visits ( n = 869 ) .
The remaining sample for analysis consisted of 12,121 participants .
For each race - gender group , all anthropometric measures were converted to Z - scores using the following equation : Z - score = ( individual anthropometric value - group mean ) / group SD anthropometric value .
We used repeated measures Cox proportional hazard regression analysis to determine the risk of developing T2DM for each anthropometric measure .
Survival time for development of T2DM was calculated with right - censoring as the mid - point of the time - interval from the visit when the participant was a non - case to the visit when they first met the criteria for diabetes .
Time accumulated to the end of the study was calculated for participants who remained non - cases or were lost to follow - up in our sample .
All seven anthropometric measures plus age , diabetes status , and survival time were available at all four study visits .
The AIC was used to assess the quality of the estimate with the step - wise addition of age in each anthropometric model .
Anthropometric measures with the smallest AIC values were considered best - fit anthropometric measure models within race - gender groups .
Harrell ’ s C - index , a rank parameter , was used as a measure of general predictive power of the Cox proportional regression model [17] .
Harrell ’ s C - index was constructed by regressing T2DM on each anthropometric measure adjusted for age in separate anthropometric models , then assessing the fit of the model .
Anthropometric models with the highest Harrell ’ s C - index concordance areas were chosen as the best - fit discriminators of anthropometric measures within race - gender groups .
To determine the anthropometric measures with the highest associations , we ranked the hazard ratios within race - gender groups by their magnitude of effect from most to least , and contrasted this with their corresponding Harrell ’ s C - indexes .
We further tested the equality of Harrell ’ s C - index concordance areas of the pair - wise comparable discriminatory ability of the best - fit anthropometric measure with each of the other anthropometric measures ( six pairs ) within race - gender groups , by examining the Harrell ’ s C - index and its p value [17] with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing [18] Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata MP , Version 14.0 ( StataCorp , College Station , Texas , U.S . ) .
For most analyses , p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant ; for Bonferroni multiple comparisons testing [18] , p < 0.008 ( 0.05 / 6 ) was used .
All analyses for time - to development of T2DM , including hazard ratios , Harrell ’ s C - indexes , and AIC statistics were bootstrapped 5000 times with robust covariance structure and the efron method of ties .
Ethical committee of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) , New Delhi approved the study protocol in accordance with National Guidelines by Indian Council of Medical Research .
All the subjects were recruited with their signed consent on ethically approved consent form informed in both Hindi and English after explaining the purpose and implications of the study by the well trained field investigator .
Study Design and Subject Recruitment : The study was conducted between 2006 and 2010 at the TB Laboratory , Clinical Microbiology Division , Department of Laboratory Medicine , All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi in collaboration with designated microscopy centers ( DMC ) and DOTS centers of South Delhi region ( Khanpur , Dakshinpuri , Madangir , Safdarjung , and Shahpur Jat ) .
After approval of the study from the central TB control division of Government of India , we approached the DMCs of the respective area to identify the smear positive patients diagnosed at their respective DMC within last two weeks .
All the sputum smear positive patients were contacted at their place of residence , their detailed clinical history was noted and after written consent , 508 index PTB cases and 1792 family contacts were recruited .
However , after further work - up 62 PTB patient refused consent for inclusion in the study , and 18 had no regular house hold and thus these were excluded .
Similarly out of 1792 recruited family contacts , 961 refused to give blood sample and 42 were found to have co - prevalent TB and thus grouped into the PTB group ( please see Figure 1 ) .
Finally a total of 1259 subjects were enrolled in the study .
All PTB cases , whether untreated , relapse , or under treatment ( but not responding to treatment ) were included in the study .
All the demographic details and relevant clinical symptoms , signs and duration were documented in predesigned subject information form .
TB patients were defined as PTB cases where infection of lungs , pleural cavities or respiratory tracts with M . tuberculosis occurs and the disease is diagnosable with chest X - ray , smear microscopy , culture or had favourable response to antitubercular treatment .
Household contacts in this study were defined as all the family members / tenants / groups generally living together in the same shelter with same front door and who live in prolonged / intense contact with the PTB patient [32] .
Among the household contacts only contacts who had no symptoms of TB infection in preliminary investigation were included in the present study .
Preliminary diagnosis of PTB was made at local designated microscopy centers ( DMC ) after examining patient ’ s morning or spot sputum samples .
After obtaining information of smear positive patients we noted the contact details of the patients and field worker contacted the patient ’ s family and fixed the appointment for sampling .
A repeat sputum ( 1 morning plus 1 spot ) sample and 5 ml blood were collected ( before doing Mantoux test ) in sterile containers and samples transported on the same day to TB Laboratory , Clinical Microbiology Division at AIIMS for further processing .
The asymptomatic healthy contacts who could not produce good quality sputum , even the saliva samples were accepted for the study .
The sputum / saliva samples were processed after decontamination by modified Petroff ’ s ( NALC / NaOH ) method [33] .
The processed sputum samples were inoculated in MGIT ( Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube ) of automated BACTEC ™ MGIT 960 culture system following manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Becton Dickinson , USA ) .
Ziehl - Neelson ( ZN ) staining followed by microscopy was done on both direct and decontaminated sputum samples for acid fast bacilli ( AFB ) .
Serum was separated from the blood samples by centrifugation and stored at − 20 ° C for further use in ELISA avoiding repeated freezing and thawing .
Tuberculin skin test ( TST ) or Mantoux test was carried out by intradermally injecting 0.1 ml of 5TU ( Span Diagnostics Ltd , India ) purified protein derivative ( PPD ) into the volar surface of the forearm .
While injecting PPD it was ensured that level of tuberculin syringe needle was facing upward so that a pale elevation of the skin ( a wheal ) , 6 to 10 mm in diameter , was formed .
Mantoux test was done only after withdrawing blood sample .
The patients were instructed not to apply any soap / detergent or wash the area to avoid itching and scratching for the next 48 hours .
The injection site was encircled by permanent marker and reaction induration ( palpable , raised , hardened area or swelling ) was measured in millimeter ( mm ) after 48 - 72 hours [32] , [34] .
The test was performed by well trained field investigators .
Recording the Details of BCG Vaccination : BCG status was determined using visual inspection of scars .
The subjects with clearly visible scar were considered as BCG vaccinated and remaining without scar as non - vaccinated .
We screened published literature for performance of dozens of commercial serological tests offered for sale in Indian market and selected Pathozyme ™ Myco IgG , IgA and IgM , EIA kits manufactured by Omega Diagnostic Limited , Scotland , UK [35] .
These kits were selected because of more / or widespread use , comparative better performance as available on the public domain and combination of antigens used in it [24] .
These kits are based on two highly purified immunodominant antigens , the cell wall lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) antigen which , and a 38 - kDa mycobacterial recombinant antigen [35] .
The kits claimed to be having 91 % specificity and 72 % sensitivity [36] .
The EIA tests were performed according to the instructions provided in kits ’ manual ( Omega diagnostics limited , Scotland , UK ) .
All three EIA kits were evaluated simultaneously with the same serum samples aliquots stored at − 20 ° C .
For proper analysis of performance , ELISA tests were evaluated first on asymptomatic household contacts and then on confirmed PTB cases .
Sensitivity and specificity was determined using confirmed PTB cases and asymptomatic contacts as positive and negatives references .
Other statistical analysis , such as Positive predictive values ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) and likelihood ratio for positive ( LRP ) test were also calculated with 95 % CI ( confidence intervals ) .
PPV ( also called precision rate ) is the proportion of subjects with positive test results who are correctly diagnosed for infection .
NPV is defined as the proportion of subjects with negative test result who are correctly ruled out of infection .
Higher PPV and NPV denote more correct assessment .
Likelihood ratio of positive ( LRP ) test helps to predict the likelihood of true positive result allowing the clinician to better interpret the results of the diagnostic test .
A LRP of greater than 1 indicates the test result is associated with the presence of disease and less than 1 means the test result is associated with the absence of the disease .
Percentage agreement was assessed between the results of Mantoux test and EIAs .
To rule out the proportion of agreement by chance , Cohen ’ s kappa test was used .
To check the effect of BCG vaccination on the performance of EIAs and Mantoux test , Pearson Chi - square test and exact mid - p test were used .
P - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
STATA SE .9 software was used for all statistical analysis .
We used data from the District Level Household and Facility Survey 3 ( DLHS - 3 ) , a nationwide household survey at district level , conducted in 2007 - 2008 in 34 Indian states and territories [19] .
The DLHS - 3 was designed as a cross - sectional study that used a stratified , systematic , multistage cluster sampling design [19] .
The basic Indian vaccination schedule is proposed by Universal Immunization Programme ( UIP ) .
The UIP is the largest immunization program in the world and targets 27 million infants annually .
The UIP protects children against 7 vaccine - preventable diseases : tuberculosis , diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , polio , measles ( added in 1985 ) and hepatitis ( added in 1990 ) .
Vaccines are provided free of cost and delivered through strategies such as routine immunization , village health and nutrition days , and outreach campaigns [20] .
In keeping with the definition in standard use in India , full immunisation is defined as a child 12 - 23 months of age receiving all of the following vaccines : a dose of BCG vaccine at birth ( or as soon as possible ) ; three doses of DPT vaccine at 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age ; at least three doses of OPV at 6 , 10 and 14 weeks of age ; and one dose MCV at 9 months of age .
Vaccination information of 12 - 23 month - old children in DLHS - 3 was obtained either from health cards or from mother ’ s or caregiver verbal reports .
We created two binary outcomes to study non - vaccination in this sample .
First , children 12 - 23 months of age who had not received any of the following eight vaccine doses ( 1 dose of BCG vaccine , 3 doses each of DTP vaccine and OPV , and 1 dose of MCV were considered completely unvaccinated ( CUV ) , and were compared to children who had received at least one dose of vaccine .
Second , children were considered to have received no routine immunisation ( no RI ) if they had not received any of the five recommended doses administered only through routine services ( 1 dose of BCG vaccine , 3 doses of DTP vaccine , and 1 dose of MCV ) , and were compared to children who had received at least one routine immunisation dose .
Full immunization coverage can be attained only through improving routine immunisation systems .
For several decades , as part of the global eradication initiative , India has had a very strong polio programme operating largely in campaign mode in parallel to routine immunization services [21] , [22] .
We therefore also studied those children 12 - 23 months of age who had not received a single dose of vaccine from routine immunization services .
Individual and household ( compositional ) characteristics : We included the following compositional variables : child sex ( male or female ) , birth order ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and more ) , mother ’ s age ( 15 - 24 , 25 - 34 , or 35 years or older ) , mother ’ s and father ’ s educational attainment ( 0 year , 1 - 5 years , 6 - 8 years , 9 - 10 years , 11 - 12 years , or 13 or more years ) , caste ( scheduled tribe , scheduled caste , other backward caste - OBC - and general ) , religion ( Hindu , Muslim and others i.e. Sikh , Christian , Buddhist and others ) , antenatal care - ANC - ( prenatal visits , tetanus injection during pregnancy ) , postnatal care ( No PNC within 2 weeks ) , and household wealth .
Household wealth index was computed by combining household assets and material possessions by IIPS and divided into quintiles ( poorest to the richest groups accounting for the lowest to the highest quintiles ) .
Contextual characteristics are defined at community , district and state levels .
State - level characteristics considered included area of residence ( urban and rural ) and region of residence categorised into two groups as follows : The first group included Empowered Action Group States ( EAG ) and Assam ( EAGA ) .
The EAG states , which account for about 45 % of India ’ s population and have particularly high fertility and mortality indicators , were designated as “ High Focus States ” by the Indian Government in 2001 .
Due to lagging social and demographic indicators , Assam is often considered with this group .
EAGA states were : Assam , Bihar , Chhattisgarh , Jammu and Kashmir , Jharkhand , Madhya Pradesh , Orissa , Rajasthan , Uttar Pradesh , Uttarakhand ) .
The second group ( other states ) included : Arunachal Pradesh , Manipur , Meghalaya , Mizoram , Sikkim , Tripura , Andaman and Nicobar Islands , Andhra Pradesh , Chandigarh , Dadra and Nagar Haveli , Daman and Diu , Delhi , Goa , Gujarat , Haryana , Himachal , Pradesh , Karnataka , Kerala , Lakshadweep , Maharashtra , Pondicherry , Punjab , Tamil Nadu , West Bengal ) .
We used the term community to describe clustering within the same geographical living environment .
Communities were based on sharing a common primary sample unit ( PSU ) within the DLHS - 3 data as it is the most consistent measure of community in the DHS surveys [23] .
Since poverty and education characteristics of communities were not directly available , they were constructed by aggregating individual - level characteristics at the PSU level .
Specifically , these weighted measures were derived by summing the values obtained on individual women in each community and dividing then by the total number of women respondents living in each one .
The community ’ s poverty status was defined as the proportion of households below 20 % of wealth index .
The proportion of women with no formal education was generated from native individuals in the database and aimed to represent female illiteracy in the community .
In our study , these group - measures were based on an average of 3 women per community ( from 1 to 31 ) , which provides a sufficient number 1 ) to generate reliable estimates [24] and 2 ) to use Monte Carlo Markov Chains for achieving our computations [25] .
The entire national sample ( n = 65,617 ) of children aged 12 - 23 months was analyzed .
Data typically have a hierarchical structure in which children were nested within mothers , mothers were clustered within households , households were nested within communities which were clustered within districts , and finally districts were nested within states .
To account for unequal selection probabilities and ensure representativeness of the sample , we applied the appropriate sampling weights .
Determinants of non - vaccination were assessed by using Bayesian binomial regression models .
We specified a 4 - level model for each binary outcome y , i.e. , non - vaccination , for child i living in community j in district k and state l .
Probability was related to a set of categorical predictors X and a random effect for each level by a logit - link function as logit ( π ijkl ) = β 0 + β X + u0jkl + v 0kl + f0l .
A child level was defined by collapsing child - , mother - and household - level data .
The linear predictor of the equation consisted of a fixed part ( β 0 + β X ) estimating the conditional coefficients for the covariates .
The 3 random intercepts were respectively attributable to communities ( u0jkl ) , districts ( v 0kl ) and states ( f0l ) , each assumed to have an independent and identical distribution and variance estimated at a corresponding level .
All models were estimated by using Bayesian methods implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulation and the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm [26] .
We used diffuse default prior distribution for all parameters [26] .
Starting values of the distribution were derived from two previous estimations using Iterated Generalized Least Squares ( IGLS ) and second order penalised quasi - likelihood linearization ( PQL 2 ) .
MCMC estimation was adopted in the analysis to reduce bias in the estimates of random effect parameters .
Indeed , such bias can arise when multilevel models with discrete outcomes are estimated using maximum - likelihood procedures [27] - [29] .
All estimations were performed by MLwiN within STATA 12 MP ( Stata , Corp . ) and MLWiN 2.26 through runmlwin procedure [30] .
Our computations were based on chains of length 50 000 iterations after a burn - in of 5000 .
Bayesian deviance information criterion ( BIC ) was used to estimate the goodness of fit of consecutive models [31] The BIC values for each model were compared , and the model with the lowest value was considered the better one for hierarchical models [31] .
We examined separately the association between non - vaccination and compositional ( individual - household ) and contextual variables .
The first model is a null model ( Model 1 ) , which provides information on the extent to which communities , districts and states vary and further justify assessing random effects at these levels .
Model 2 included only individual characteristics while model 3 contained community characteristics .
Model 4 expanded model 3 by adding individual level variables .
We further fitted a fifth model to analyse a cross - level interaction between household wealth and area of residence ( rural and urban ) .
Since we found a significant ( p = 0.035 ) interaction term ( area of residence * wealth index ) , we present separate models including all individual and contextual variables stratified for rural and urban areas of residence .
The fixed effects , i.e. , the association between non - vaccination and selected variables , were shown as odds ratio ( OR ) with its 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) .
Meanwhile , random effects ( measures of variation ) were estimated by median odds ratio ( MOR ) rather than using intra - cluster correlation ( ICC ) which is better fitted for linear models [32] , [33] .
The MOR quantifies the unexplained contextual heterogeneity , otherwise it quantifies contextual - level variance on the odds ratio scale and is always greater than or equal to 1 [32] .
This study is based on an analysis of existing survey data with all identifier information removed .
The survey was approved by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare , Government of India and the International Institute of Population Sciences ( IIPS ) institutional review board .
All study participants gave informed consent before participation and all information was collected confidentially .
Data of DLHS - 3 were obtained from the IIPS as they are made available in the public domain for analysis by researchers .
Therefore , no additional ethics review is required for this work by the Montreal University committee of ethics .
UKCTOCS was approved by the UK North - West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee ( International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial , number ISRCTN 22488978 ; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00058032 ) .
Approval for the current analysis was obtained from the Joint UCL / UCLH Ethics Committee on the Ethics of Human Research ( Committee A ) , Ref : 07 / H0714 / 81 , ethical approval granted on 11th April 2013 ) .
The main trial design , including details of recruitment and screening techniques has been detailed elsewhere [23,24] .
In brief therefore , over 1.2 million women aged 50 - 74 in the UK were invited to be screened for ovarian cancer .
Over 200,000 women were recruited between April 2001 and October 2005 through 13 centres in England , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Women completed a recruitment questionnaire and provided written consent to use of their data in secondary studies .
They were randomised to control ( no intervention ) or annual screening using either serum CA 125 or transvaginal ultrasound ( TVS ) based strategy .
All participants were followed up using their National Health Service ( NHS ) number through the appropriate national agencies for cancer registrations / deaths as well as by postal questionnaires .
The most recent cancer registrations for this analysis were received from Health and Social Care Information Centre ( HSCIC ) on 17th June 2014 .
Women were also linked to their Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) records that were available for the period 1st April 2001 to 31st March 2010 for participants treated in the English NHS .
HES is an electronic administrative database funded by the NHS which holds records on both inpatient and outpatient procedures for patients resident in England [25] .
The study population consisted of all women resident in England , enrolled in UKCTOCS , who were diagnosed with EC between April 2001 and December 2009 , and for whom HES records were available .
Patients with a concurrent diagnosis ( synchronous ) of primary peritoneal or ovarian cancer in addition to primary endometrial cancer , missing stage or incomplete HES data ( possibly due to patients transferring their care outside the English NHS ) were excluded .
The notification of EC diagnosis was received from multiple sources , the cancer registries ( through the Health and Social Care Information Centre ( HSCIC ) and HES ( Hospital Episode Statistics ) which were searched using the ICD - 10 codes of C54 ( malignant neoplasm of corpus uterus ) and C55 ( malignant neoplasm of uterus , part unspecified ) , from self - reporting on the postal follow - up questionnaire or direct contact from the volunteer or their physician .
Hospital records which included surgical and pathological reports were retrieved and independently reviewed by a clinician using an Outcomes Review form who confirmed EC diagnosis , stage using the FIGO classification [26] , grade and histological subtype .
UKCTOCS trial data provided patient characteristics including date of birth , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) collected at recruitment , hospital records of women diagnosed with EC and date of death .
For confidentiality reasons only the month and year was available for the date of birth and date of death ; each entry was arbitrarily assigned to the 15th of the relevant month .
HES provided date of admission , date of transfer or discharge , diagnosis ( as ICD - 10 codes ) [27] , procedures undertaken ( coded using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys ( OPCS ) Classification of Surgical Operations version 4 codes ) [28] , treatment specialty , Healthcare Resource Group ( HRG ) [29] codes for reimbursement , and patient deprivation ( measured as the Index of Multiple Deprivation ( IMD ) which is a geographically determined index based on areas of approximately 1500 people ) [30] .
We included all HES inpatient and outpatient episodes related to EC .
Assignment for inpatient procedures was based primarily on OPCS - 4 procedure codes taking into account the HRG code and treatment speciality .
Outpatient records were less complete and procedure codes were rarely available .
Outpatient records lacking procedure codes were only included where the fields coding the main specialty or the treatment speciality contained a code relating to either oncology or gynaecology .
Investigations occurring within six months prior to diagnosis were included .
Procedures were further classified into surgery ( hysterectomy , BSO and pre - surgical investigations ) , adjuvant therapy , and further treatment ( including management of complications ) .
Estimating costs of inpatient and outpatient episodes : Costs were assigned to episodes of care on the basis of the associated HRG code [29] .
This is a type of Diagnosis Related Groups ( DRG ) used to assign a reimbursement tariff in the English NHS .
Version ( 3.5 ) was used , which allowed assignment of the 2005 Payment by Results ( PbR ) tariff to episodes from the entire period 2001 to 2010 [31] .
We then inflated the cost to 2012 / 13 prices using the Hospital & Community Health Services Index [32] .
Finally we multiplied each cost by 1.08 which is the average Market Forces Factor for Hospitals in the English NHS [33] .
Market Forces Factors are applied to payments generated from HRG codes to adjust payments for unavoidable differences in costs relating to the geographic location of each hospital [34] .
In addition to estimating cost on the basis of HRG code we adjusted costs for extended length of stay .
A maximum length of stay is specified for each HRG code and length of stay beyond this point is reimbursed at a daily tariff specific to that HRG .
Where patient length of stay during a spell in hospital exceeded the maximum specified for the HRG code we applied the appropriate excess bed day adjustment to the estimated cost .
PbR tariffs distinguish inpatient and outpatient procedures , and ( for inpatient procedures ) elective versus emergency admissions .
We assumed that all inpatient admissions were elective procedures as we lacked data on the type of inpatient admission .
Hospital admissions are remunerated per spell ( from admission to discharge ) .
Generally a spell consists of one episode of care , but occasionally it may consist of more than one episode .
In the latter situation hospitals are remunerated according to the dominant procedure for the component episodes ( typically the most expensive ) .
We applied the costs for the most expensive episode for spells of care consisting of multiple episodes .
Inpatient episodes with missing HRG code ( 20 % ) were assigned a code on the basis of OPCS procedure codes .
The majority of outpatient episodes had no HRG or OPCS code assigned .
We identified records of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on the basis of the interval between admissions and the assigned treatment specialty ( medical or clinical oncology ) .
These records were assigned the appropriate outpatient PbR tariff for radiology or chemotherapy .
The remaining outpatient episodes were assigned the average outpatient cost for 2012 / 13 of £ 135 per episode [32] .
We had missing cost data in the form of censored observations where five year follow - up date and date of death exceeded 31st March 2010 ( data available from HES ) .
We had further missing data on histological subtype ( 0.4 % ) , grade ( 3.2 % ) , IMD ( 0.4 % ) , and BMI ( 0.8 % ) .
IMD scores were used to partition patients into quintiles .
We applied a binary classification of histological subtype which grouped Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia ( AEH ) and Endometrioid EC versus all other EC histological subtypes .
We used multiple Imputation ( MI ) to impute the missing data [35] .
MI is a principled approach which fully captures the additional uncertainty generated in the imputation process [36-37] .
Further details on the application of MI are provided in the supporting information ( S1 File ) .
Costs arising in years following the first year after diagnosis were discounted at 3.5 % according to recommendations on technology assessment by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence ( NICE ) [38] .
FIGO stage was specified as follows : stages IA & IB ; stage IC ; stage II ; stage III ; stage IV .
We subdivided costs into three categories : surgery ; adjuvant therapy and further treatment as detailed above .
Costs accumulated at two years after diagnosis are reported for the subset of patients with a minimum of two years follow - up in HES ( diagnosis prior to 31st March 2008 ) .
Total costs ( after imputation of missing data ) were determined for all patients at five years from diagnosis , with non - parametric 95 % confidence intervals estimated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the data ( details in appendix ) .
Costs accumulated at five years after diagnosis for patients with complete cost data ( diagnosis prior to 31st March 2005 ) are provided in the supplementary material ( Table A in S1 File ) .
Regression modelling was undertaken to explore the impact of patient characteristics on cost .
We fitted Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) regression models to each of the three cost categories and to total costs .
We pre - specified the following covariates : age , year of diagnosis , histological subtype ( as Endometrioid Carcinoma / AEH or other ) , grade , stage , IMD quintile , Charlson score [39] and BMI .
We categorised BMI as under 18.5 ; 18.5 to 30 ; over 30 .
Year of diagnosis was specified as the number of years following the earliest diagnosis date in the sample ( January 2002 ) .
Charlson scores were determined from ICD - 10 codes recorded for the hysterectomy ( or the first inpatient procedure following diagnosis in the absence of hysterectomy ) after exclusion of codes for cancer or metastases .
Dates of death were available until June 2014 .
Deaths were assigned to EC where the original underlying cause of death was EC ( ICD - 10 codes C54 .0 , C54 .1 ) .
Regression modelling was used to investigate the impact of patient characteristics on survival over the total observation time considering both all cause and cancer specific mortality .
Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to the data that adjusted for the same covariates selected for the cost analysis ( detailed above ) .
A Therneau and Grambsch test was applied to assess the appropriateness of an assumption of proportional hazards [40] .
All statistical analysis was undertaken in Stata , version 13.1 [41] .
Data were collected using a multi - method approach consisting of semi - structured interviews with stakeholders on nurse prescribing in the Netherlands and an extensive document analysis .
Stakeholder interviews provided the primary source of data .
We aimed to include representatives of all organizations that were involved in the nurse prescribing debate in the Netherlands .
This included representatives of overarching nurses and medical associations as well as more specialist associations , such as the Association for Diabetes Care Professionals ( EADV ) and the Dutch College of General Practitioners ( NHG ) .
A list of key organizations was compiled in consultation with experts on nurse prescribing from the Royal Dutch Medical Association ( KNMG ) and the Dutch Nurses ’ Association ( V & VN ) .
Potential informants were also selected in consultation with these experts and were approached by the researchers to take part in the study .
Representatives received an information letter explaining the aims of the study , the voluntary nature of participation and an invitation to participate in an interview .
Participant consent was assumed upon accepting this invitation and participation in an interview .
Of the 16 representatives invited per email and telephone , 13 ultimately participated ( see Table 1 for a list of all interviewed stakeholders ) .
Twelve interviews were with a single informant and one was with two representatives of one organization interviewed together .
The informants held policy - or board positions within their organization , and their answers represent the organization ’ s point of view .
Every interview was conducted by one or two researchers ( MK , LVD , PG and / or AF ) who were trained in qualitative interviewing techniques .
The interviews were semi - structured and were guided by a topic list that was drafted after the findings of an earlier systematic review of the literature on nurse prescribing [35] .
Interview topics were : general information about the informant / organization , vision on nurse prescribing , degree of support for nurse prescribing , introduction of nurse prescribing , the legal - , educational - and organizational conditions for nurse prescribing , and challenges and threats to the work of doctors and nurses because of nurse prescribing .
All interviews but one were recorded and a summary of the interview was sent to each representative to be edited , where necessary , as an accurate representation of the organization ’ s viewpoint .
Representatives could mark sections of the interview summary as ‘ off the record ’ , in addition to sections they already noted as ‘ off the record ’ during the interview itself .
All ‘ off - the - record ’ requests ( n = 2 ) were granted in full .
One interview was conducted by letter , at the request of the organization .
The approved interview summaries formed the basis for analysis .
Table data removed from full text .
Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0077279.t001 List of interviewed stakeholders .
No ethical approval was deemed necessary for this study as the information that was collected did not refer to peoples ’ individual opinions or behaviors but exclusively to organizational points of view concerning nurse prescribing .
However , all informants consented that the approved interview summaries , in which their organizations were mentioned by name , could be used in research publications .
Moreover , all informants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time during or after the interview .
All data collected were handled as required by the rules of the Dutch Data Protection Act ( Dutch : Wbp - Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens ) and the applicable codes of conduct for scientific researchers .
Raw data ( i.e. the approved interview summaries ) are available upon request from the first author , but only after permission from the organization concerned has been obtained .
In addition to stakeholder interviews , document analysis provided information that was used to supplement data collected through interviews .
Considerable effort was made to obtain relevant documents , such as policy documents , position papers , newspaper articles , letters to the Minister of Health , and government documents regarding nurse prescribing , from various sources .
These sources included the websites of the associations that were interviewed , digital archives of their professional journals , digital government archives and the LexisNexis database of national newspaper articles .
Because most of these websites lacked advanced search facilities , we used combinations of the following keywords , where possible , to search for relevant documents from the last 10 years : “ prescriptive authority ” , “ nurses ” , “ nurse specialists ” , “ prescribing ” , “ medicines ” and “ task substitution ” .
For government archives , the additional search terms “ 32.196 ” and “ 32.361 ” were used , because these were the numbers of the ( draft ) bills on prescriptive authority for nurses .
Documents selected for inclusion were searched manually to identify further relevant documents .
We included all documents in which knowledge claims were expressed by either ( a representative of ) the medical profession , the nursing profession , or both ; where these knowledge claims referred to ( the introduction of ) nurse prescribing ; and where there was no question of individual views .
We included a total of 34 documents in the study .
The oldest document included dates back to 2003 , but the majority of retrieved documents was from recent years .
We performed a thematic analysis of the approved interview summaries and documents gathered through the document analysis [36] .
Data analysis began at an early stage in the research to introduce any necessary changes in the interview protocol .
Data were coded using MAXQDA 2007 qualitative data analysis software [37] and were analyzed both inductively and deductively .
Guided by our theoretical model , we searched the data for concepts that were directly linked to interprofessional tensions around nurse prescribing .
Additionally , data were analyzed inductively and compared for common statements and claims .
Subsequently , recurring themes were identified and classified , and text fragments were sorted according to the thematic framework .
Three of the researchers took part in internal discussions of the analysis and themes were discussed until consensus was reached .
Analysis of the data identified the following thematic elements : illegal nurse prescribing , professional domains , ( exclusive ) task / knowledge area doctor / nurse , preconditions for nurse prescribing , protocols / guidelines , comorbidity / polypharmacy and routine aspects of prescribing .
Based on these themes , we distinguished the knowledge claims used by the nursing and medical professions .
Quotations were chosen to illustrate the knowledge claims .
It should be noted that these quotations came from the interview summaries that were approved by the interviewees .
Our study has largely been reported according to the COREQ guidelines [38] , see Checklist S1 .
The OP 6 cell line was cultured at 33 ° C in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM , Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) , as described previously [29] .
For RNA FISH , cells were seeded on 22cm 2 coverslips coated with 0.1 % gelatin ( Sigma ) in a 6 well plate at about 50 % confluency and expanded for one day until near confluency .
For colony RNA FISH , cells were seeded at ~ 2,000 cells per slide and grown for 7 - 8 days ( 50 cell colonies ) or at ~ 10,000 cells per slide ( 4 cell colonies ) , and grown for 2 - 4 days .
Long intron probes for some RNA FISH experiments were synthesized using Long Range polymerase ( Qiagen ) with sequence - specific primers ( see S1 Table ) and incorporation of DIG - 16 - dUTP ( Sigma ) into PCR products .
We utilized intron probes for OR RNA FISH for three reasons : ( i ) we can design longer intron than exon probes ( enhanced sensitivity ) ; ( ii ) for genes ( like ORs ) expressed at low levels , unprocessed RNAs at the native locus are more spatially concentrated than processed RNAs in the cytoplasm ( enhanced sensitivity ) ; ( iii ) the one - spot ( monoallelic ) nuclear signal is an important validation of an OR signal ( enhanced specificity ) .
For most RNA FISH experiments , the long - intron PCR products ( PCR primer sequences are provided in S1 Table ) were cloned into pCRII - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) ; prepared plasmids were linearized prior to in vitro transcription using SP 6 or T7 polymerases ( Roche ) for production of sense - or antisense - specific probes with incorporation of DIG - 16 - dUTP or Biotin - 16 - dUTP ( Sigma ) .
100 ng of labeled probe was combined with 5 μ g Cot 1 - DNA ( Invitrogen ) and 10mg salmon sperm DNA ( Sigma ) in a 2 × SSC , 10 % dextran sulfate solution , and heat denatured .
For two - color RNA FISH colony experiments , 20ug of E . coli tRNA ( Sigma ) and 50ug of BSA ( Sigma ) were added to reduce background .
Cells were permeabilized with 0.5 % Triton - X in CSK buffer , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , and dehydrated in a 70 % - 80 % - 95 % - 100 % ethanol series .
Probe and cells were incubated overnight at 37 ° C in a humidified chamber .
Following washes ( maximum stringency = 50 % formamide , 0.5 × SSC at 37 ° C ) , samples were blocked for subsequent antibody incubations ( 4 % BSA , 4 × SSC , 0.2 % Tween - 20 ) .
DIG signals were visualized using sheep anti - DIG FITC ( 11207741910 , Roche ) and donkey anti - sheep FITC ( sc - 2476 , Santa Cruz Biotech ) antibodies , at a 1 : 100 dilution in 1 % BSA , 4 × SSC , 0.2 % Tween - 20 .
Biotin signals were visualized using avidin - DCS rhodamine ( A2012 , Vector Labs ) , followed by biotinylated anti - avidin antibody ( Ab 73235 , Abcam ) plus an additional incubation with the avidin - DCS rhodamine , each used at 1 : 100 dilution in 1 % BSA , 4 × SSC , 0.2 % Tween - 20 .
For OR re - selection assays , we used 6 long - intronic DNA probes against 40 small colonies for each probe ( 240 total colonies ; 975 total cells were screened ) and 6 larger colonies each ( 36 total colonies ; 2,497 total cells were screened ) .
In addition , we conducted two - color RNA FISH experiments using the Olfr 920 ( labeled with DIG ) and Olfr 57 ( labeled with biotin ) probes in order to investigate whether small colonies are able to activate more than one OR gene .
For measuring expression frequencies in a well - defined lineage , we used sense / antisense RNA probes against 9 OR genes on 28 total cultures ( 2 - 5 replica cultures per probe ) .
Images were acquired using a Deltavision RT imaging system ( Applied Precision ) adapted to an Olympus ( IX 71 ) microscope equipped with XYZ motorized stage .
Each image was sectioned with 0.5 μ m intervals to ensure complete coverage of the nucleus .
ImageJ ( Fiji ) was used for analysis of positive cells .
Method considerations for OR profiling : We considered various methodologies for profiling OR representation in OP 6 cell populations .
We estimate that OR mRNA yield from a positive OP 6 cell is roughly in the 10 - 100 template range based on relative expression levels of abundant ORs from previous qPCR experiments .
For example , if we assume that frequently represented OR genes are expressed in ~ 1 - 2 % of OP 6 cells ( as observed in RNA FISH experiments herein , see text ) , then observed actin : OR cDNA ratios in full OP 6 cell populations would be ~ 50 - 100 - fold greater than the actin : OR cDNA ratio in single positive cells .
The observed actin : OR ratio for a set of commonly expressed OR genes ( e.g. , Olfr 920 , Olfr 544 , and Olfr 57 ) averaged ~ 6,500 : 1 ( not shown ) , suggesting ~ 65 - 130 - fold actin excess in single OR - positive cells .
We approximate the actin transcript abundance at ~ 103 − 104 molecules per cell [34-36] , and therefore estimate the OR transcript abundance to be between ~ 8 mRNAs ( assuming ~ 103 actin mRNAs at ~ 130 - fold excess relative to OR mRNA ) and ~ 150 mRNAs ( assuming ~ 104 actin mRNAs at ~ 65 - fold excess relative to OR mRNA ) .
These estimates are consistent with OR template numbers for relatively low - abundance genes in typical cells .
With this low OR transcript abundance in mind , we decided against using RNA - seq for three reasons :
( 1 ) Assuming a positive OP 6 cell contains at most ~ 100 OR transcripts , and estimating ~ 105 total RNA transcripts per cell [ 37 , 38 ] , we reasoned that the putative median OR in the population ( expressed in ~ 1 / 1,000 OP 6 cells ) might be < 1 transcript per million transcripts from an OP 6 population ( or , < 1 FPKM ) .
This is commonly the noise cutoff threshold used in RNA - seq to account for false - positives in alignment or other technical limitations [ 39 , 40 ] .
( 2 ) In order to obtain a reliable number of sequence reads per OR ( e.g. , > 100 hits per gene ) , we would need to sequence to a depth > 100 million reads per sample , which was not financially feasible when considering our goal of characterizing numerous OP 6 populations within several well - defined lineages .
( 3 ) The cDNA preparation protocols commonly utilized prior to sequencing involve competitive enrichment ( e.g. , polyA isolation , PCR - based amplifications ) , which potentially introduces methodological biases that are particularly skewed against low - copy number transcripts [ 41 , 42 ] .
Obviously , we did not want potential methodological biases to obscure our interpretation of apparent OR expression biases .
To achieve the desired sensitivity while mitigating potential amplification bias , we developed a nested PCR strategy detailed in the following section .
We optimized cDNA preparation and nested PCR protocols to identify a condition for each OR gene tested that ( a ) reliably and reproducibly gave robust products on gDNA diluted to < 100 templates , and ( b ) reliably and reproducibly did not generate products in no - RT controls for various RNA preparations from OP 6 populations .
We were able to develop nested PCR assays that satisfy the above criteria for 21 OR genes .
Each OR gene was investigated in cell populations across various OP 6 cell lineages .
Approximately 5x 106 OP 6 cells per culture were harvested and RNA was extracted using Trizol ( Thermo Fisher / Life Technologies ) .
Approximately 5 μ g of RNA was treated with DNase ( Thermo Fisher / Ambion ) and further purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) .
Approximately 500 ng of resulting RNA was subjected to first - strand cDNA synthesis by SmartScribe reverse transcriptase ( Clontech ) , followed by PCR using multiplexed OR primer pairs for 20 cycles .
A second nested PCR reaction was conducted for the 21 OR genes ( individual reactions , not multiplexed ) with cycle numbers optimized to report 50 - 100 OR templates from known gDNA quantities , while maintaining cleanly negative results in no - RT controls from various OP 6 cell populations .
All PCR primer sequences are provided in S1 Table .
The < 100 template sensitivity threshold was chosen because we estimate that this is approximately the OR template yield from one positive OP 6 cell ( see above ) .
In our analyses of various OP 6 cell populations , we input unamplified cDNA corresponding to the equivalent of ~ 400 and ~ 2,000 OP 6 cells , thus reporting ORs that we estimate are expressed in > 1 / 400 ( > 0.25 % ) and > 1 / 2000 ( > 0.05 % ) cells , respectively .
Therefore , these two sensitivity thresholds should permit surveying the middle portions and upper half of a normal distribution that models OR frequencies for the null hypothesis in which all ORs are represented by a completely stochastic selection process .
Thirty five training subjects were recruited consecutively between May 2010 and August 2011 and 35 control subjects between May 2009 and May 2010 at the Division of Neurodegenerative Diseases , Department of Neurology at Dresden University of Technology .
The control subjects participated in a longitudinal olfactory study .
Eligible subjects were 18 years of age or older , had received the diagnoses of PD according to UK Brain Bank criteria [15] , and were on stable anti - parkinsonian medication for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and during the study .
The following exclusion criteria had been defined : Identifiable cause of parkinsonism or signs for atypical parkinsonian disorders , dementia , and psychiatric conditions interfering with study participation .
Detailed information about the experiment was given to all participants and written consent was obtained .
All aspects of the study were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki .
The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Board of the Faculty of Medicine of Dresden University of Technology .
The training group performed olfactory training over a period of 12 weeks .
Patients exposed themselves twice daily to four odors ( phenyl ethyl alcohol ( PEA ) : rose , eucalyptol : eucalyptus , citronellal : lemon , and eugenol : cloves ) .
These four odorants were chosen to be representative of four odor categories claimed by Henning [16] in his work on the “ odor prism ” ( Geruchsprisma ) , where he tried to identify primary odors ( compare [17] ) .
These categories are flowery : blumig ( e.g. , rose ) , foul : faulig , fruity : fruchtig ( e.g. , lemon ) , aromatic : wurzig ( e.g. , cloves ) , burnt : brenzlig , and resinous : harzig ( e.g. , eucalyptus ) .
Training patients received four brown glass jars ( total volume 50 mL ) with one of the four odors in each ( 1 mL each , soaked in cotton pads to prevent spilling ) .
All jars were labeled with the odor name .
Patients were asked to sniff the odors in the morning and in the evening for approximately 10 seconds each .
To focus their attention on the training , they were asked to keep a diary in which they rated their overall olfactory abilities each Sunday ( data not analyzed ) .
Further , patients received a phone call by one of the experimenters 4 weeks after the training started ( 1 ) to ask about the patients ' olfactory function and ( 2 ) to maintain compliance with the training procedure .
Patients in the non - training group were advised to wait and see how the olfactory function would change .
Olfactory testing was performed before and after the training period of 12 weeks using the “ Sniffin ' Sticks ” test kit [18] which involves tests for odor threshold , odor discrimination , and odor identification .
Using commercially available felt - tip pens , the odorants were presented approximately 2 cm in front of both nostrils for 2 seconds .
PEA odor threshold was assessed by a single - staircase , 3 - alternative forced choice ( 3 - AFC ) procedure .
Three pens were presented to the patient in a randomized order , two contained odorless solvent ( propylene glycol ) and the other an odorant in a certain dilution .
The patient ' s task was to indicate the pen with the odorant .
Concentration was increased if one of the blanks was chosen and decreased if the correct pen was identified twice in a row .
The mean of the last 4 of a total of 7 reversal points was used as detection threshold ( ranging from 1 to 16 ) .
A total of 16 odor concentrations were tested starting from a 4 % stock solution ( dilution ratio 1 ∶ 2 ; solvent propylene glycol ) .
The second subtest assessed the ability of the patient to discriminate different odors .
Again , 16 triplets of pens were offered , each including two identical odors and a different one .
The patient ' s task was to indicate the pen which had a different smell .
The score was the sum of correct responses ranging from 0 to 16 .
Both threshold and discrimination testing was performed with the patient being blindfolded .
For testing of odor identification , 16 pens containing common odors were offered .
The patient had to identify each of the odorants from a list of four descriptors .
The sum of the scores from the three subtests resulted in the TDI - score ( Threshold , Discrimination , Identification ) with a maximum of 48 points .
A score of 30.5 points or more indicates normosmia , a score between 16.5 and 30 points indicates reduced olfactory function in terms of hyposmia , and a score of less than 16.5 points indicates functional anosmia .
While thresholds for PEA were measured using the single - staircase paradigm within the Sniffin ' Sticks test kit ( see previously discussed data ) , thresholds for the other odorants used for training ( eucalyptus , eugenol , and citronellal ) were assessed by means of the method of ascending limits [19] , using a 3 - AFC procedure .
This procedure was chosen because it is slightly faster than the staircase procedure , although it may be somewhat less reliable [20] .
Odors were presented in brown glass jars , similar to the presentation of PEA using the “ Sniffin ' Sticks ” .
Two of the jars contained odorless solvent ( propylene glycol ) , the other an odorant in a certain concentration .
The patient ' s task was to indicate the jar with the odorant .
Correct identification was assumed when the patient correctly identified the same odor concentration three times in a row .
A total of eight odor concentrations for each odor were tested starting from 4 % stock solutions ( dilution ratio 1 ∶ 4 ; solvent propylene glycol ) .
Between tests of the odorants , subjects rested for approximately 5 minutes to minimize adaptation .
Data were analyzed by means of SPSS 19.0 ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , Ill , USA ) .
If not mentioned otherwise , all data are displayed as means ± standard deviation ( SD ) or numbers ( % ) , significance level was set at p < 0.05 ( two - tailed test ) .
Bonferroni tests were used for post - hoc analyses .
Pearson statistics were used for correlational analyses .
Systematic reviews of reviews have been particularly advocated to inform policy , clinical , and research deliberations by providing an evidence - based summary of inter - related technologies [9] .
Our approach involved drawing on established systematic review methodology ( i.e. , those developed by The Cochrane Collaboration ) to ensure rigour by minimising the risk of bias [10] ; we also drew on more novel methods of evidence synthesis ( i.e. , those developed by the UK National Health Service [ NHS ] Service Delivery and Organisation Programme ) with the aim of producing an overview that we hoped would prove useful to decision makers [11] .
We present here a summary of the methods used .
Inherent difficulties associated with systematic reviews of health care organisation and delivery intervention include the considerable effort required at the outset to facilitate their conduct [9] .
Accordingly , we began with an in - depth exploration of the fields of health care quality and safety , as well as eHealth functionalities used in health care delivery .
This exploration entailed conceptually mapping the fields to understand various processes involved as well as how these relate to each other .
For quality and safety considerations , we identified existing taxonomies and frameworks to facilitate this conceptual mapping exercise , which helped to delineate the scope of our work .
For the field of eHealth , we drew from existing team members ' conceptual and empirical work to aid our construction of a conceptual map for eHealth technologies [12] , [13] .
This exercise allowed us to categorise interventions with regards to over - arching similarities .
We characterised eHealth technologies as having three main overlapping functions : ( 1 ) to enable the storage , retrieval , and transmission of data ; ( 2 ) to support clinical decision making ; and ( 3 ) to facilitate remote care .
Given the strategic focus of the English National Programme for Information Technology ( NPfIT ) ( and other similar large - scale programmes ) on electronic record and professional decision support systems [1] , the first two functions were prioritised in this initial phase of our work .
The current reported work thus concerns the related areas of EHRs , PACS , CPOEs , ePrescribing , and computerised systems for supporting clinical decision making .
Remote care and consumer health informatics are the subjects of a subsequent 3 - y research enquiry , which is currently in progress .
We drew on established Cochrane - based systematic review principles to search for relevant systematic reviews .
An inclusive string of MeSH and free terms ( Text S1 ) was developed to query PubMed / MEDLINE , EMBASE , and the Cochrane Library contents for secondary research reports published from 1997 up to 2007 with no restrictions placed on language .
The bibliographies of reports identified as potentially relevant were reviewed as was a catalogue of secondary research amassed through various contributions by team members .
Additional searches of key health informatics resources , namely the conference proceedings and publication databases of the American Medical Informatics Association and the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality , were also undertaken .
Finally , the Internet was searched using the Google and Google Scholar search engines .
Searches were periodically updated to ensure that the most recent publications were included with the last update occurring at the end of April 2010 .
Selection and Critical Appraisal of Systematic Reviews : On the basis of the areas identified for prioritisation , we developed a detailed list of interventions that were to be included / excluded ( Text S2 ) .
End users of applicable interventions were limited to health care professionals ; any findings relating to patient - focused interventions were therefore excluded .
Of interest were systematic reviews that focused on the assessment of patient , practitioner , or organisational outcomes .
We detailed the following methodological criteria for the identification of systematic reviews : ( 1 ) reference to the study as being a systematic review by the authors within the title , abstract , or text ; and / or ( 2 ) evidence from the description of the methods that systematic review principles had been utilised in searching and appraising the evidence .
All systematic reviews having been identified as potentially suitable were assessed for inclusion by two independent reviewers , with arbitration by a third reviewer if necessary .
Data from systematic reviews meeting the above criteria , henceforth referred to as “ reviews , ” were independently critically reviewed by two reviewers , and relevant data were abstracted .
Systematic reviews not primarily concerned with assessing impact on patients , professionals , or the organisation , but nonetheless intervention focused , were drawn on to provide additional contextual information .
These supplementary systematic reviews ( henceforth referred to as “ supplementary reviews ” ) were not subjected to formal critical appraisal .
Critical appraisal was undertaken using an adapted version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme ( CASP ) tool for systematic reviews [14] .
These modifications were informed by the growing literature regarding both the methodological and reporting issues with primary research in health informatics ( Table S1 ) .
The details of this process and the tool ' s associated properties will be the subject of a separate publication in due course .
A standard approach was taken for each of the eHealth technologies of interest .
Definitions were first clarified and then the individual use and broader scope for deployment conceptualised .
Juxtaposing this with the aforementioned conceptual maps of the fields of eHealth , quality and safety provided a literature - based framework for delineating the principal theorised benefits and risks associated with each intervention .
We used this framework to guide synthesis of the empirically demonstrated benefits and risks of implementing eHealth technologies .
The body of literature identified was too diverse to allow quantitative synthesis of empirical evidence and we therefore undertook a narrative synthesis .
This synthesis involved initially describing the technologies and outcomes studies using the above - described framework for each of the included reviews , which was followed by developing a summary of our assessment of and the key findings from each review ( Table S2 ) .
We then employed a modified version of the World Health Organization ' s Health Evidence Network system for appraising public health evidence , which classifies evidence into three main categories , i.e. , strong , moderate or weak ; this assessment being based on a combination of the overall consistency , quality , and volume of evidence uncovered .
These review - derived data were then thematically synthesised in relation to each of the technologies under consideration , drawing on key findings from the additional reviews , as appropriate [8] .
This study was conducted according to the appropriate ethical guidelines and approved by the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
Participants were at least 18 years old and were fully informed of what the study involved .
Because obtaining signed consent was impractical in the online study , the IRB approved a waiver for signed consent .
No sensitive information was collected , and all data were confidential .
We analyzed only anonymous data .
We report all data exclusions , all manipulations , and all measures .
The data and analysis files and all laughter clips are available online ( https://osf.io/ca66s/ ) .
We recruited 768 online participants on Amazon ’ s Mechanical Turk and TurkPrime [47] to “ rate 50 very brief audio clips of people laughing ” in exchange for $ 2 ( all participation occurred May 11 - 12 , 2017 ) .
Five participants reported audio malfunctions and one participant reported that he did not listen to the sounds before rating them ; excluding these participants resulted in a sample of 762 ( see Table 1 for participant demographics ) .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0183811.t001 Participant demographics .
After reading the consent information , participants were randomly assigned to judge the degree to which the laugh samples communicated a meaning related to one of the four dimensions ( spontaneity n = 172 , reward n = 254 , affiliation n = 166 , dominance n = 170 ) .
Each participant evaluated the laughs on just one of the four rating scales so experimental demands would not lead them to rate each laugh as high on only one dimension .
Due to a programming error , the reward condition was oversampled .
Each participant rated a subsample of 50 laughs randomly drawn from the entire pool of 400 laughs .
Each laugh was rated on a given dimension approximately 24 times ( 762 participants * 50 judgments ) / ( 400 laughs * 4 rating dimensions ) .
Instructions asked participants to rely on their “ spontaneous impressions ” to “ rate the extent to which you think the … description fits this clip ” .
The descriptions , which varied across conditions , were accompanied by a 10 - point Likert scale ( 1 = “ not at all ” , 10 = “ very much ” ) : Spontaneity condition : “ Laughter can sometimes be spontaneous . You could feel that someone ’ s laughter is unintentional and is occurring outside of their control . ”
Reward condition : “ Laughter can sometimes be rewarding .
You could feel that someone ’ s laughter means they like something that you did or said . ”
Affiliation condition : “ Laughter can sometimes be reassuring . You could feel that someone ’ s laughter means they are acknowledging you and want you to know they are not threatening . ”
Dominance condition : “ Laughter can sometimes be mocking .
You could feel that someone ’ s laughter means at this moment they feel superior to or dominant over you . ”
After rating 50 laughs , participants answered several demographic and task feedback questions .
To maximize the variability of our laughter sample , we obtained our stimuli from Sound Snap , a professional online sound library ( soundsnap.com ) .
Sound Snap ’ s voice recordings are licensed by sound designers and producers ; as such , they are largely produced in recording studios and often sound artificial .
This is particularly important to consider in laughter , as spontaneity strongly influences perceiver judgments .
However , we think it is appropriate to use these somewhat artificial stimuli in the current study for two reasons .
Firstly , our social functional account is agnostic about the feeling states underlying an expression , instead seeking to identify common social consequences .
Secondly , posed and synthetic facial expressions have been instrumental in identifying the action units relevant to certain emotions or social functions [48] , and distilled , sometimes caricatured expressions often exaggerate the most essential features of an expression [49] .
On April 19 , 2017 , we used the following keywords in a Sound Snap search , which returned 598 audio clips : LAUGH * - * BOY * - * GIRL * - CARTOON * - GROUP * - CROWD * - ANIMAL - WOMEN - MEN - LADIES - KID - BAB * - TODDLER * - TALK * - SPEECH - SPEAK * - MANIC ( dashes precede excluded keywords ) .
Clips were then eliminated from the initial search return for the following reasons : contained no adult human laughter ; contained speech , ambient noise , or multiple speakers ; were low - quality vintage recordings ; or were tagged with the words “ ghost , ” “ clown , ” “ cartoon , ” or “ crazy . ” This resulted in 400 relevant laughter samples ( 256 male , 144 female ) .
We then trimmed any silence from the beginning and end of the samples .
Eleven acoustic features were extracted from the 400 laugh samples using PRAAT [50] ( see Table 2 for descriptive statistics ) .
We describe the variables and the motivation for their inclusion in the current study below : Duration : The duration of the laughter sample in seconds , log - transformed to correct for positive skew .
In at least one study , spontaneous laughter bouts were longer than volitional bouts [ 30 , cf 3 ] .Intensity : The mean intensity , or loudness , in dB .
Greater intensity may be an indicator of reduced inhibition [51] or increased laughter spontaneity [3] .
Pitch variables : F0 mean refers to mean fundamental frequency , or pitch , as calculated using PRAAT ’ s auto - correlation technique .
F0 range is the difference between the lowest and highest F0 for each sample .
Standard deviation of F0 divided by the total duration ( SD F0 / duration ) of the sample captures the average moment - to - moment variability in pitch ; this variable was log - transformed to correct for positive skew .
Slope is the mean absolute F0 slope , which measures how sharply the pitch changes occur by dividing the difference between a local F0 maximum and minimum ( at intervals of .01 seconds ) by the duration it takes to go from one to the other .
Raised F0 and greater SD F0 / duration and F0 range are associated with spontaneity in laughter [3,30] .
Steeper F0 slopes are associated with high arousal emotion states [52] .
To correct for the skewed distribution of pitch variables on a Hertz scale , F0 mean , slope , and F0 range were transformed from Hertz to a semitone scale ( 12 * log ( X ) ) , with F0 range calculated as a ratio of the maximum to minimum F0 ( 12 * log ( maximum / minimum ) ) [3] .
Spectral variables : Center of gravity refers to the spectral centroid , which accounts for the weighting of noise across the sample ( log - transformed ) .
Changes in center of gravity can correspond to the oral - nasal distinction in vowels [53] and the perception of vowel height in nasal vowels [54] .
More generally , center of gravity is an indicator of the timbre , or brightness , of a sound , with higher centers sounding brighter [55] .
Spontaneous laughs in one study had higher centers of gravity than volitional laughs [30] .
Harmonics - to - noise ratio is the average degree of periodicity in dB ; a higher value indicates a purer , more tonal sound , and a lower value indicates a noisier vocalization .
Proportion voiced is the proportion of frames that are voiced as opposed to unvoiced .
Voiced segments are nearly periodic , while unvoiced segments are noisier , and include exhalations and snorts [12] .
Previous work showed that spontaneous laughs have more unvoiced segments [30] and longer intervals between voiced bursts [3] compared to volitional laughs .
Laughs intended to portray teasing and schadenfreude have lower harmonics - to - noise ratios than laughter intended to portray tickling [29] .
The spectral variables should be interpreted cautiously due to the laughter samples ’ unknown recording environments and possible compression at some point in the editing process .
Formant variables : F1 mean and F2 mean , or the first and second formants ( transformed to semitones ) , are peaks in the sound spectrum that help determine the vowel sound of a vocalization .
Lowering F1 and raising F2 results in a “ higher ” vowel ( e.g. , shifting from / a / to / i / ) .
Spontaneous and rewarding laughter may be expected to feature high F1 means based on previous research [56] , as a higher F1 is associated with higher arousal [57] .
Raised F2 can convey increased positivity [58] .
A general raising of the vowel sound , which involves increasing the relative dispersion of the first and second formants , creates the illusion of a smaller body size [19] , as formant spacing is much more strongly related to body size than F0 [59,60] .
Furthermore , open vowel sounds are associated with high - arousal calls in monkeys [61] .
Formant positioning therefore has the potential to predict perceptions of all four social dimensions in laughter [21] .

Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0183811.t002 Summary statistics for the 11 acoustic measures and subjective ratings for the 395 laughs included in the key analyses , separated by the sex of the actor ( female n = 142 , male n = 253 ) .
Note .
Where indicated , pitch variables have been transformed to a semitone scale ( ST ) for analyses , although F0 Mean is also reported in Hertz .
F0 Range is the change in semitones from the minimum to the maximum pitch .
* Indicates that a variable was subsequently log - transformed for analyses due to non - normality , identified via visual inspection .
Five laugh samples were removed from subsequent analyses because they had no voiced frames and were therefore missing values for pitch variables .
Inspecting the summary statistics suggests participants rated these unvoiced laughs as lower on reward ( M = 2.84 , SD = 2.23 ) , affiliation ( M = 3.04 , SD = 2.29 ) , and dominance ( M = 4.26 , SD = 3.23 ) than the other 395 laughs ( mean spontaneity ratings are not noticeably different , M = 4.82 , SD = 3.05 , see Table 2 for descriptives of included laughs ) .
Subjects : Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey ( L.A .FANS ) : Wave 1 L.A .FANS participants included a representative cross - sectional sample of all households across 65 neighborhoods ( census tracts ) of in Los Angeles County ; poor neighborhoods and families with children were oversampled [25] . , [26] Participant interviews were completed between April 2000 and January 2002 , with high completion rates among respondents selected for interview , 89 % of primary care givers , 87 % of randomly selected children , and 86 % of siblings of randomly selected children .
Interviews were successfully completed for 3200 children and adolescents ( ages 0 - 17 years ) , with a balanced distribution across age groups .
Wave 1 participants provided data on individual , familial , and neighborhood factors , for themselves and household members ; census data was also incorporated to provide social characteristics of each neighborhood , such as poverty levels and racial / ethnic composition .
Our analyses included 3,114 children and adolescents ( ages 0 - 17 years ) with data on our outcome of interest .
We ascertained child ’ s lifetime asthma status via the primary caregiver ’ s report of an asthma diagnosis within the parent module of L.A .FANS .
Children were categorized as asthmatic if the primary caregivers reported a positive response to the following item : “ has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that [ child ’ s name ] has asthma ? ”
Similar questions to ascertain asthma diagnosis have been used within the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC ) survey and the National Survey of Children ’ s Health [27] , [28] Over 97 % of children within L.A .FANS had a response to this question .
Perceived neighborhood safety was measured by several items administered in the adult module of L.A .FANS .
Experiences of neighborhood crime were assessed via response to the following item , “ while you have lived in this neighborhood , have you or anyone in your household had anything stolen or damaged inside or outside your home , including your cars or vehicles parked on the street ? ”
An additional measure of perceived neighborhood safety was captured through the adult ’ s extent of agreement with the following item , “ you can count on adults in this neighborhood to watch out that children are safe and do not get in trouble ” ; response options for this item were strongly agree , agree , unsure , disagree , and strongly disagree .
Participants were also asked how safe is it to walk around alone after dark within your neighborhood , with response options as extremely safe , somewhat safe , somewhat dangerous , or extremely dangerous .
At the individual level , child ’ s age , gender , and race / ethnicity were included .
At the household level , we examined primary caregiver ’ s education ( years ) , primary caregiver ’ s history of asthma , and primary caregiver ’ s current smoking status , health insurance status , and use of public assistance within the past 12 months .
Covariates controlling for the home environment include whether the interviewer observed the presence of crowding , cleanliness or clutter , and potential health or structural hazards inside and immediately outside of the home at the time of the interview .
To examine associations between asthma outcomes and perceived neighborhood safety , individual , and family characteristics , we conducted a series of two level multilevel logistic regression models of 3,114 children at level 1 nested within 65 census tracts at level 2 .
Use of multilevel modeling allows us to account for natural and sampling induced nesting within L.A .FANS , as well as model contextual heterogeneity ; directing inquiry away from average effects , to inquire about differences and examine potential neighborhood variation in asthma [29] .
Multilevel models are also appropriate when causal processes are thought to operate at more than one level ; as asthma is a multi - factorial disease which is influenced not only by compositional factors ( such as genetics ) but also by contextual factors ( such as neighborhood violence ) , single level regression models would be inappropriate [30] .
We first examined the effects of neighborhood safety characteristics on the odds ratio of reporting an asthma diagnosis ( Model 1 ) and subsequently adjusted for the effects of individual characteristics ( Model 2 ) , followed by primary caregiver ’ s characteristics ( Model 3 ) , and lastly physical characteristics of the indoor home environment and neighborhood poverty ( Model 4 ) .
Quasi - likelihood methods were used to estimate the coefficients beginning with marginal quasi - likelihood ( MQL ) with 1st order Taylor linearization to obtain starting values for 2nd order penalized quasi - likelihood ( PQL ) approximation .
Data manipulation and descriptive analyses were conducted using STATA 11 , while multilevel models were conducted using MLwiN version 2.10 .
The data were collected by the RAND Corporation in collaboration with the UCLA School of Public Health .
Written consent for participation in the study was obtained for L.A .FANS respondents by RAND Corporation in collaboration with the UCLA School of Public Health .
Data for secondary analyses were obtained through submission of a restricted application process which included a data safeguarding plan , data user agreement , and IRB review .
The research was approved by the Harvard School of Public Health Office of Human Research Administration .
The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information ; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1 .
This was a randomised , active controlled , parallel designed trial .
The study protocol has been previously published [10] .
This multicentre trial was conducted in three clinical research centres of South Korea from June to November 2010 : Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine ( Daejeon University Hospital ) , DongGuk University Ilsan Oriental Hospital and Dongshin University Gwangju Oriental Hospital .
The research protocol was approved before study onset by the institutional review board ( IRB ) of each participating hospital .
Participants were independently recruited by each centre through advertisements in local newspapers .
The protocol was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( Identifier : NCT 01105221 ) before participant enrolment .
Written informed consent was obtained from all of the participants .
Patients aged nineteen to sixty five years old with aggravating dry eye symptoms in a single eye or in both eyes were recruited [1] .
Physicians and ophthalmologists assessed participant eligibility [11] .
Inclusion criteria were based on the following ophthalmologic tests : a tear film break - up time ( TFBUT ) below 10 seconds and a Schirmer Ι test ( with application of alcaine , a local anaesthetic ) value below 10 mm / 5 minutes [12] .
These ophthalmologic tests were performed by the ophthalmologists who did not know the allocation results .
Participants with several conditions were excluded : pathological changes of the eye , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , external injuries and eye - surgery history affecting dry eye .
Participants who had been taking or needed active treatment for dry eyes were also excluded , as were patients with punctal occlusion history or current usage of anti - inflammatory eye drops .
Contact lens use was prohibited throughout the participation period .
Participants were allocated into either acupuncture or artificial tears evenly .
Random numbers were generated through computerised block - randomisation with the SAS package ( SAS ™ Version 9.1 , SAS Institute , Inc . , Cary , NC ) by separate statistician .
Opaque assignment envelopes with consecutive numbers for each centre were used for allocation concealment .
The necessary sample size was calculated from the results of previous studies regarding the effects of acupuncture [11] , [13] and artificial tears [14] .
The mean difference ( standard deviation ) of ocular surface disease index ( OSDI ) after acupuncture treatment was 17.61 ( 15.61 ) , and after artificial tears ( sodium carboxymethylcellulose ) , it was 11.3 ( 6.3 ) [13] , [14] .
Anticipating a 20 % dropout rate , a total of 150 participants was recruited and was evenly assigned to each centre ( 50 participants in each centre ) .
Acupuncture was administered according to the theory of traditional Korean medicine ( TKM ) without using lubricants .
An expert committee composed of clinical experts and researchers working on acupuncture research or ophthalmologic practice of TKM decided on acupuncture points and needling methods based on published literature and textbooks about acupuncture for ophthalmologic diseases or dry eye syndrome [9] , [15] .
Certified practitioners with at least 7 years of TKM education and 3 years of clinical experience performed the acupuncture treatment .
To reduce non - specific effects originating from the close relationship between patients and practitioners , interactions were strictly limited [16] .
Seventeen acupuncture points ( bilateral BL 2 , GB 14 , TE 23 , Ex 1 , ST 1 , GB 20 , LI 4 , and LI 11 and single GV 23 ) , located according to the WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region , were treated with 0.20 × 30 - mm disposable acupuncture needles ( Dongbang Co . , Korea ) [17] .
The depths of inserted needles differed but were approximately 0.6 to 3 cm for the acupuncture points at the face and head ( BL 2 ∶ 1.5 to 3 cm ; GB 14 ∶ 0.9 to 1.5 cm ; TE 23 ∶ 1.5 to 3 cm ; Ex 1 ∶ 1.5 to 3 cm ; ST 1 ∶ 0.6 to 0.9 cm ; GV 16 ∶ 0.9 to 1.5 cm ) and 3 to 4.5 cm for points of hand ( LI 4 ) and arm ( LI 11 ) .
Each acupuncture needle was twisted until patient felt a ‘ deqi ’ sensation and retained for 20 minutes before removal .
Participants had acupuncture treatments three times per week for four weeks ( a total of 12 treatments ) .
Preservative - free single - use artificial teardrops ( 0.5 % sodium carboxymethylcellulose ) were provided , and participants were advised to use them as needed ( at least once per day ) for four weeks .
A diary of both the frequency and quantity of drops used was collected at every visit .
In both groups , other treatments for dry eyes were forbidden during the four weeks of treatment .
However , during the follow - up period , participants were allowed to use any kind of treatment for dry eyes , and participant reports on treatment usage were requested at every visit .
Outcome assessment included two aspects , subjective ophthalmologic tests and objective questionnaires for both ocular symptoms and quality of life related to dry eyes .
The primary outcome was the difference in OSDI changes between the two groups .
The secondary outcomes were the differences in 100 mm VAS for the ocular discomfort , quality of life questionnaire using the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile - 2 ( MYMOP - 2 ) , TFBUT , Schirmer Ι test ( with anaesthesia ) score and adverse event rate of acupuncture treatment and artificial tears usage .
Both eyes were assessed for the evaluation of TFBUT and Schirmer Ι test , respectively .
Outcomes were assessed 13 weeks after the first visit .
OSDI is a validated questionnaire consisting of twelve questions for evaluating ocular symptoms and worsening conditions related to dry eyes [18] .
Each question has a score between zero and four , where zero indicates “ none of the time ” and four indicates “ all of the time ” .
The OSDI score was calculated according to the following formula : OSDI = [ ( sum of scores for all questions answered ) * 100 ] / [ ( total number of questions answered ) * 4 ] .
The score ranges from 0 to 100 , and higher scores represent a more severe dry eye state .
The minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) of OSDI for dry eye syndrome is suggested to be 7.3 to 13.4 points in severe dry - eye patients [19] .
A version translated into the Korean language was used [20] .
A 100 mm VAS for self - assessment of ocular discomfort was reported by participants .
Ocular symptoms related to dry eye ( e.g. , ocular itching , foreign body sensation , burning , pain and dryness , blurred vision , sensation of photophobia , ocular redness , and sensations of tearing ) were quantified and summarised in a standard 100 mm VAS scale .
The QOL section of the MYMOP - 2 was adopted for assessing dry eye - related QOL [21] , [22] .
A seven - point Likert scale ( from zero as ‘ excellent ’ to six as ‘ worst ’ ) was used for the assessment of QOL grade .
The question was “ During last week , how would you express your quality of life related to dry eyes , overall ? ” .
Tear film break - up time ( TFBUT ) is a test for assessing tear film stability [23] , [24] .
Sodium fluorescein ( 2.5 % ) was applied to both eyes , and the interval between the blink of eyes and the first appearance of a dry spot or disruption in the tear film was measured .
If TFBUT is below 10 sec , it suggests at least a moderate severity of dry eyes [1] , [12] .
The Schirmer Ι test ( with anaesthesia ) is a diagnostic method to measure the basic quantity of tear secretion [12] .
After application of local anaesthesia , Schirmer test paper ( Color Bar , Eagle Vision , USA ) was placed in the lateral third of the lower eyelids for 5 minutes with closed eyes .
If the Schirmer test result is below 10 mm / 5 min , it also suggests at least a moderate severity of dry eyes [1] , [12] .
General improvements of dry eye - related symptoms were assessed by practitioners and participants using a five - grade Likert scale : excellent , good , fair , poor and aggravation .
For the evaluation of safety issues , we assessed adverse events rates of acupuncture and artificial tears .
If unexpected responses happened , the type and frequency were collected .
The type and frequency of adverse events were reported for each group .
According to the criteria of the WHO Toxicity Grading Scale for Determining The Severity of Adverse Events , the severity of the adverse event was evaluated by practitioners as grade 1 ( mild ) to grade 4 ( life threatening ) [25] .
OSDI , VAS and quality of life were assessed by separate outcome assessors who did not perform acupuncture treatment .
TFBUT and Schrmir Ι test were evaluated by ophthalmologists .
To determine the differences between the acupuncture and artificial tears groups , the changes in values from baseline were compared at each visit on an intention - to - treat basis at a 95 % significant level .
Missing data of dropped - out participants were assigned by the last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) method .
Participant expectations of acupuncture treatment for dry eye symptoms were collected with a nine - point Likert scale and were compared between the two groups [26] .
Key baseline characteristics including risk factors for dry eyes such as computer use , age , occupational environment , contact lens usage , etc . were evaluated for the difference between two groups .
ANCOVA ( Analysis of Covariance ) were used for continuous outcomes such as OSDI score , TFBUT , Schirmer test result , QOL and VAS for self - assessment of ocular discomfort , adjusted for baseline values and research centres as covariates .
Adjusted differences , which were calculated from the ANCOVA model , were reported at each visit to estimate the effect size .
Chi - squared tests were used for dichotomous outcomes such as general improvements of dry eye - related symptoms and differences in the usage of additional treatment during follow - up period .
As suggested in the study protocol , repeated measures of analysis of variance for OSDI were performed to show trend changes .
Statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical package .
Morocco ’ s National Tuberculosis Program is well - established and funded by the Ministry of Health .
TB care and medicines are provided free of charge .
TB diagnosis , treatment initiation , and follow - up occur at regional public pulmonary clinics ( CDTMR ) .
Patients are given TB medications via Directly Observed Therapy ( DOT ) at local primary care clinics or dispensaries .
Study sites included nine CDTMR and one referral hospital in cities with TB “ hot spots ” ( TB incidence of ≥ 400 / 100 K ) : Tangier , Rabat , Sale , Casablanca , Kenitra , and Fez .
We conducted a questionnaire - based , case - control study between June , 2010 , and October , 2011 .
Adult patients with definite or probable pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB who either defaulted from TB treatment ( cases ) or successfully completed it ( controls ) were enrolled .
Treatment default was defined as an interruption in TB treatment for ≥ 2 consecutive months .
Patients identified by review of the registries at study sites were contacted by clinic staff and asked to participate .
Patients who defaulted and returned to clinic on their own were also enrolled .
Upon enrollment of a case , the next two patients who presented for an end - of - treatment visit with an outcome of treatment success ( treatment completion or cure ) at that same site were enrolled as controls .
To describe risk factors for default , a structured questionnaire was developed based on results of previous studies [5] - [8] , [14] .
Cases were also asked to describe in their own words the reasons they defaulted .
Data collected via direct patient interview were augmented through chart review .
A blood sample was collected for HIV testing .
A sputum sample was collected from cases for sputum smear evaluation according to the Ziehl - Nielson method .
Samples were cultured on Lowenstein - Jensen media at the regional TB laboratory or the National TB Reference Laboratory ( LNRT ) .
Drug susceptibility testing ( DST ) for isoniazid ( H ) , rifampin ( R ) , ethambutol ( E ) and streptomycin ( S ) was performed on all positive cultures at LNRT as previously described [16] .
Culture data from one city did not meet quality control standards and were excluded from final analyses .
Study participants provided written informed consent .
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Mohammed V University Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Rabat and by the institutional review board of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
Using data from a previous retrospective study [14] , we estimated that 80 cases and 160 controls would give us 90 % power to detect a difference of 20 % or more in the most important risk factors for default .
To compare characteristics of cases and controls , we used Pearson ’ s χ 2 or Fisher ’ s exact tests for categorical variables and student ’ s t tests for continuous variables .
Multivariable logistic regression that included significant risk factors identified in univariate analyses was performed and used to develop a predictive model for treatment default .
Variables with a p - value less than 0.2 in univariate analyses were included in the full model .
Stepwise backward elimination methods were used to select the variables in the final model .
For variables without evidence of multicollinearity , each variable ’ s significance as a predictor was tested by comparing the residual deviance of the nested model without the variable to that of the full model using the likelihood ratio test [17] , [18] .
Only those variables that were independently associated with default as indicated by a p - value less than or equal to 0.05 were retained in the final model .
In addition , to avoid overfitting , Akaike ’ s Information Criterion ( AIC ) was taken into consideration in constructing the final model .
In the model , knowledge of treatment duration was treated as a dichotomous variable .
Those individuals who correctly stated the expected treatment duration for their TB disease were characterized as knowing treatment duration .
Those who did not know or who gave a wrong answer were characterized as not knowing treatment duration .
Smoking status was categorized as current , former , or never .
In the model , current and never smoking were compared to former smoking .
A survey tool to identify patients at high risk of default was developed by assigning points to each risk factor based on its coefficient in the predictive model .
Different point cut - offs were tested to obtain the optimal sensitivity and specificity .
Goodness of fit was tested using the Hosmer - Lemeshov test , where a p - value of > 0.05 indicated that there was no significant difference between the collected data and that predicted by the model [19] .
The models ’ accuracy was tested by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ( AUC ) and its 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , where AUC that was significantly greater than 0.5 indicated that the model predicted the data better than chance [20] .
Raw data were entered into Microsoft Access using EpiInfo .
Data analyses were performed in SPSS ( SPSS Statistics for Windows , Version 20.0 . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp ) and confirmed in R ( Version 3.0.1 , The R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) .
For open - ended questions , the relative frequency of each type of response is presented along with representative quotes .
Results of the quantitative analysis were compared to patients ’ responses and to perspectives of local health care workers with extensive experience caring for patients with TB collected in a parallel study [15] .
This mixed methods approach was used to explain and extend the results of the quantitative analysis [21] , [22] .
Fifty - four volunteers ( 34 female ) participated in the current study .
Ages ranged from 19 to 63 years ( M = 26.2 , SD = 7.9 ) .
The study was marketed as an eyewitness experiment and the participants were mainly students recruited from different departments at Lund University .
All participants gave written informed consent and also agreed to have the interaction audio recorded .
The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Psychology of Lund University and has been conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki .
In short , the procedure of the experiment contained five steps : first the participants were shown a film of a kidnapping , and then they filled out a questionnaire about events in the film .
After this their answers were manipulated using sleight - of - hand .
A discussion about their manipulated answers followed in an attempt to create choice blindness .
Finally , a second questionnaire was administered in order to test the effect of the potential choice blindness .
A more detailed account follows .
The participants were tested singly and the experiments started off by showing each participant a four - minute film on a 42 ” screen .
The film was shot from a first - person perspective and shows the kidnapping of a young woman from a bus stop .
Two men disembark from a car and approach the woman , then make her unconscious using chloroform .
In the commotion the older , glasses - wearing man pulls out a gun , whilst the younger , cap - wearing man drags the woman into their car before they drive off from the scene .
The film has been used in previous eyewitness research [49-51] .
After the film was shown , the participants filled out a two - paged statement questionnaire , containing 20 statements about the film ( e.g. The older man wears glasses ) .
The questionnaire was influenced by the design used by Hall et al . [4] .
Six of the 20 statements were target items ( Table 1 ) that were manipulated , discussed with all participants , and the basis of the data analysis .
The remaining 14 were filler items .
For half of the participants items 9 , 15 and 20 ( version one ) were manipulated , and for the other half items 6 , 12 and 17 ( version two ) were manipulated .
Every other participant was assigned to version one , and every other to version two .
Thus , the different versions functioned as controls to one another . ( See S1 and S2 Files for details ) Table data removed from full text .
Table identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0173606.t001 Statements and their corresponding questions in the two questionnaires .
aThe correct answer to the statements is “ disagree . ” bThe correct answer is “ agree . ” The participants were instructed to answer each statement by marking a 96 mm long continuous scale , where a mark made to the left signified “ Disagree ” , a mark made to the right signified “ Agree ” , and a mark made somewhere in the middle of the scale signified “ Uncertain . ” If the participants had no recollection of a particular statement whatsoever , the mark was thus made on the absolute midpoint of the scale .
Several previous choice blindness studies have also used continuous scales for ratings [ 3 , 4 , 14 , 18 , 52 ] .
After the participants completed filling out the first sheet of the statement questionnaire , they handed it over to experimenter A , and continued with the second sheet of the questionnaire .
Whilst the participants were busy filling out the second sheet , experimenter A manipulated one statement answer on the first sheet .
In order to perform the manipulations the questionnaires were cleverly constructed using reattachable stickers ( Fig 1 ) .
Meanwhile , experimenter B timed the filling out of the two sheets .
Figure data removed from full text .
Figure identifier and caption : 10.1371/journal.pone.0173606.g001 A staged demonstration of how the manipulations were carried out .
( A ) The participant fills out the statement questionnaire , by indicating level of agreement on a scale .
( B ) Experimenter A pulls away the sticker with the participant ’ s answers .
( C ) The experimenter fills out a new scale , which was hidden underneath the sticker , and manipulates some of the answers .
( D ) The new , manipulated questionnaire .
There was no predetermined rule for the size of the manipulations across the scale .
Instead , the manipulations were made so that the markings were to signify a different answer along the scale , i.e. “ Agree ” , “ Disagree ” and “ Uncertain ” as described above , than the answer originally given by the participants , therefore making some of the manipulations sizeable .
Also , each manipulation was made with the intent of creating a believable pattern of responses , mimicking the response pattern of each participant .
For example , if a participant frequently marked towards the poles of the scale , the manipulations used this same pattern .
Manipulations ranged from 32.0 mm to 96.0 mm and the mean distance of the manipulations was 55.7 mm ( SD = 17.5 ) on the 96.0 mm scale .
Incorrect answers were also manipulated along the scale , in the direction of the correct answer .
While the second sheet was also manipulated in the same manner as the first , the participants were busy chatting with experimenter B .
All in all three statement answers were manipulated .
Experimenter B then discussed the same ten predetermined statements with all participants .
For every predetermined statement , the participants were asked to describe their recollection of what they had seen on the film , and justify this .
During the discussion notes were kept by experimenter A , and a sound recording was also made to support these .
After this discussion , the participants were given the memory questionnaire to fill out .
The purpose of the memory questionnaire was to examine whether the manipulations made in the statement questionnaire would affect the participants ’ recollection of what they had witnessed on the film .
It consisted of 15 questions , six of which were related to the six target items of the statement questionnaire .
This questionnaire had no scale .
For eight of the questions the participants chose between the alternatives “ Yes ” , “ No ” and “ Don ’ t know . ”
In several studies of the misinformation effect [ 19 , 26 ] a forced choice design is used in the memory questionnaire , where the participants must choose either ” Yes ” or ” No ” for the question probing the misinformation given earlier .
This is a poor reflection on reality , where people are seldom forced to give their recollection of an event if they do not have one .
Therefore , we chose to give our participants the chance to say that they did not know .
The remaining seven questions were answered in free response , where the participants also had the choice to say they did not know .
The two questionnaires hence had different designs .
There was no credible reason for the participants to fill out a questionnaire identical to the one they had just filled out and discussed a few minutes ago .
There was also a risk that the participants would strive to give the same answer in both questionnaires , rather than try to remember what they had witnessed on the film .
The scale in the statement questionnaire was therefore not graded in any way , thus making it unlikely for the participants to think of their answers in the dichotomous yes - or - no - terms used in the memory questionnaire .
To further curb this consistency endeavor , the participants were also explicitly asked to give their recollection of the film for the final questionnaire .
To facilitate a comparison between the two questionnaires , and thereby examining if a misinformation effect had occurred , the answers in the statement questionnaire were categorized .
The participants were not aware of this categorization when they gave their original answers .
To give them a fair chance to detect that the manipulation did not reflect their original opinion , the categories were verbalized during the discussion by the experimenter , for example ” The older man wears glasses … you disagree with that . ” Finally , in order to find out whether they had suspected that any of their answers on the statement questionnaire had been manipulated experimenter A asked the participants , in accordance with other choice blindness studies [ 2 , 4 , 10 , 13 , 18 ] , four detection questions : “ How did this feel ? ” “ Did you think of anything in particular during the experiment ? ” “ Did you think of anything in particular when the two of you discussed the statements ? ” and “ Did you notice anything strange about the questionnaires ? ”
After this the true purpose of the study was revealed .
During the experiment there was no delay between the different steps , and no filler task was used .
The participants were categorized as either non - detectors or detectors .
Non - detectors were those who at no point during the experiment expressed any kind of suspicion concerning the manipulations .
These participants , however , could still correct the manipulated answers , but without suspecting that the answers were not their own .
The inclusion of these participants in the subsequent analysis is in accordance with previous choice blindness studies [ 3 , 4 , 11 , 12 , 52 , 53 ] .
The participants expressed that they had misread the statement or that they had marked the wrong end of the scale : “ I was sloppy when I filled this out . I ’ m sorry !
I ’ m pretty sure he doesn ’ t hit her in the head . ”
These participants were then asked if they wanted to correct their marking to better match their recollection .
Detectors , however , expressed suspicion concerning the manipulations .
Concurrent detectors clearly stated that the manipulated answers were not their own during the discussion about the statements .
Retrospective detectors were those who , during the four detection questions at the end of the experiment , expressed that their answers had been manipulated in some way .
Both concurrent detectors and retrospective detectors were removed from the subsequent analyses .
In order to quantify the size of the choice blindness manipulations across the scale , the difference between the markings originally made by the participants and the manipulated markings was measured in millimeters .
To then examine whether the answers in the memory questionnaire were affected by the manipulations made in the statement questionnaire , the scale was divided into three equally sized parts .
A marking made in the part to the left was categorized as “ No ” , a marking made in the middle part was categorized as “ Don ’ t know ” , and a marking made in the part to the right was categorized as “ Yes . ” These three categories were chosen because these were the three response alternatives in the memory questionnaire , thus allowing a comparison between the two questionnaires .
The answers in the memory questionnaire were categorized in the following way : “ Changed in the direction of the manipulation , ” “ Changed independently of a possible manipulation ” and “ Not changed . ”
The first category “ Changed in the direction of the manipulation ” meant that a choice blind participant ’ s answer in the memory questionnaire did not belong to the same category as that given in the statement questionnaire .
For example , if the participant ’ s answer in the statement questionnaire was manipulated from “ Disagree ” to “ Agree ” , and the participant later gave the answer “ Yes ” or “ Don ’ t know ” in the memory questionnaire , the recollection would have been changed in accordance with the manipulation , as the expected answer would be “ No . ” The second category “ Changed independently of a possible manipulation ” also meant that the participant ’ s answer in the memory questionnaire did not belong to the same category as that given in the statement questionnaire .
However , this category was used either because a choice blind participant had changed their answer in the opposite direction of the manipulation , or because a participant whose markings had not been manipulated answered differently in the two questionnaires .
The third and final category “ Not changed ” meant that the same answers were given in both questionnaires .
In the main statistical analysis of the transference between the two questionnaires , item 6 , “ A yellow car stops at the bus shelter ” and item 9 , “ The older man jumps into the car and drives away ” were discarded , in part because they were answered in free response in the memory questionnaire , and in part because these items were somewhat ambiguous in their nature .
Categorizing the free response answers involved a great deal of interpretation , which was deemed too arbitrary .
The ambiguity in the wording of the statements made the participants likely to reinterpret them as they justified markings they themselves had not made .
After a reinterpretation of the statement , this no longer matched the corresponding question in the memory questionnaire .
Including the two ambiguous items , however , did not change the overall misinformation effect outcome .
That is , if all six items were included in the analysis a similar result , but with a somewhat smaller effect size , was still evident when comparing recollection of choice blind items with non - manipulated items , χ 2 ( 2 , n = 196 ) = 92.4 , p < .001 , Cramer ’ s V = 0.69 , p < .001 .
A document can be represented as a vector of word term weights ( i.e. features ) from a set of terms ( i.e. dictionary ) and the topic of a document is made of a joint membership of terms which have a pattern of occurrence [7] .
Early document clustering techniques employ the vector space modeling technique , which can calculate the similarity between two documents [8] .
This technique fails to deal with the issues caused by synonymy ( i.e. different words with similar or identical meanings ) and polysemy ( i.e. the words with different meanings in different contexts ) .
Later , Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) was developed in an effort to improve classification performance in document retrieval [9] .
Like most topic modeling techniques , LSA starts from a pre - processing step , which cleans the corpus of a set of text documents and builds a document - term matrix for subsequent modeling .
The cleaning procedures include tokenization ( i.e. partitioning a text document into a list of tokens ) , stop - word removal ( i.e. removing the words that are extremely common but are of little value in helping classifying documents , such as this , it , is ) , stemming and lemmatization ( i.e. removing the ends of conjugated verbs or plural nouns while keeping the lemma , base or root form ) , and compound words ( i.e. concatenating hyphenated words that describe one concept ) .
The remaining words are used to construct a document - term - matrix ( DTM ) .
The DTM is a matrix where each row represents a document , each column represents a unique word , and each cell denotes the number of times a given word appears in a given document .
Then , LSA reduces the DTM into a filtered DTM through singular value decomposition ( SVD ) .
Finally , LSA computes the similarity between text documents to pick the heist efficient related words .
While computationally efficient , LSA fails to identify and distinguish between different contexts of word usage without recourse to a dictionary or thesaurus [10] .
Backed by Bayesian statistics , Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) is developed to apply a probabilistic model to analyze word distributions in text documents and uncover topics in an automated fashion [7,11] .
This generative modeling technique does not require prior categorization , labelling and annotation of the texts but reveals the invisible , latent topic structure through statistical procedures [12] .
Instead , it follows the “ bag - of - words ” assumption to treat a document as a vector containing the count of each word type , regardless the order in which they appear .
In a nutshell , LDA assumes that each document can be modelled as a mixture of topics , and each topic is a discrete probability distribution that defines how likely each word is to appear in a given topic .
A document is then represented by a distribution of topic probabilities .
It estimates the parameters in the distributions of word and of topics with Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) simulations [7] .
LDA then assigns topics to each document through a Dirichlet distribution of topics .
Given a specific number of topics in a collection of text documents , the extent to which each topic ( and its associated words ) is represented in a specific document can be modelled by a latent variable model , where latent variables represent the topics and how each document in the collection manifests them [7,13] .
In short , LDA discovers patterns of word use and connect patterns of similar use to estimate the posterior distribution of hidden variables , which represents the topic structure of the collection [12,13] .
Recently , some LDA - based techniques have been proposed .
For example , Correlated - Topic - Model ( CTM ) uses a logistic normal distribution to create relations among topics [13] .
Supervised LDA [14] can introduce known label information into the topic discovery process .
Labeled LDA ( LLDA ) [15] allows for multiple labels of documents and for the relation of labels to topics represents one - to - one mapping .
Partially labeled LDA ( PLLDA ) [16] further extends LLDA to have latent topics missing from the given document labels .
LDA has been widely used to process otherwise unmanageably large volumes of text , identify the most salient topic in a single document , investigate similarities between documents , and uncover topic prevalence over time [11,13,17] .
We summarize some recent applications of LDA in scientific topic discovery in Table 1 .

We extracted article abstracts from the core collection of the Web of Science ( WoS ) database using the following criteria : articles published in English , whose topic terms ( i.e. titles , abstracts and keywords ) included “ social stratification ( s ) ” , “ social class ( es ) ” or “ social inequality ( ies ) ” in SSCI indexed journals over the period of 1956 to December 2017 .
The search found 15,057 articles .
We deleted those without keywords and abstracts , leaving 14,038 articles in the collection .
Among these articles , 67.11 % belong to “ social class ( es ) ” alone , 23.60 % to “ social inequality ( ies ) ” alone and 6.71 % to “ social stratification ( s ) ” alone .
There are 1.74 % of articles that belong to both “ social class ( es ) ” and “ social inequality ( ies ) ” ; 0.52 % to “ social class ( es ) ” and “ social stratification ( s ) ” ; and 0.26 % to both “ social inequality ( ies ) ” and “ social stratification ( s ) ” .
There are only 0.04 % of articles that belong to three topic terms .
In addition , we built three time series in terms of annual article counts for these three terms respectively .
The correlation coefficients between “ social class ( es ) ” and “ social inequality ( ies ) ” series is 0.87 , between “ social class ( es ) ” and “ social stratification ( s ) ” series is 0.86 , and between “ social inequality ( ies ) ” and “ social stratification ( s ) ” series is 0.97 .
These statistics confirm that the three topic themes are highly similar .
They all reflect the types of social divisions envisaged by Marx and refer to groups defined by their relationship to ownership and control over the means of production , of labor and of distribution [18] .
We did not include the term “ social status ” because it emphasizes the social distinctions caused not only by economic factors but also by cultural ones , which include denotative ( what is ) , normative ( what should be ) , and stylistic ( how done ) beliefs , shared by a group of individuals who have undergone a common historical experience and participate in an interrelated set of social structures [19] .
Patient cohort and settings The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information ; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1 .
This is an analysis of a subset population from our previously reported randomized cohort ( Clinical Trials.gov NCT 00644046 ) [16] .
Briefly , the cohort includes predialysis CKD patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) of < 60 formtok m − 2 ( determined by using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation ) who visited the nephrology outpatient clinics of the Department of Nephrology , Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Keelung , from July 2007 and followed up to June 30 , 2011 .
Patients aged 18 - 80 years and without renal graft failure were included in the study after obtaining informed consent from them .
A total of 2280 patients were enrolled in the study and were randomly divided into the MPE group and the non - MPE group by using a random table at study entry .
Four hundred and five patients reached ESRD needing hemodialysis after a mean follow - up of 33 ± 2.6 months ( 232 patients in the MPE group and 213 patients in the non - MPE group , as shown in Figure 1 ) .
The medical expenditure and utilization in the first 6 months of initiation of hemodialysis in these 425 patients were accurately recorded and compared between MPE and non - MPE patients .
Medical service utilization was calculated as the frequency of outpatient visits and the frequency and length of hospitalization .
Outpatient visits were categorized as outpatient services , preventive care ( e.g. , influenza vaccination and dietary counseling ) , and emergency services .
Medical service expenditures included outpatient expenditures ( all costs including physicians ' and nursing fees , examinations , surgery , and medication ) and inpatient expenditures ( all costs including laboratory testing , imaging testing , medications , surgery and consulting , ward and administrative , nasogastric tube feeding , and hemodialysis fees ) .
The expenditures for each participant were totaled to compute the sum of ambulatory and inpatient medical service utilization costs and expenditures .
The analysis of costs in this study only included those medical costs for which our hospitals made reimbursement claims to the NHI .
The salaries , overheads , and administrative costs of the care team were not included .
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the institutional review board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital ( Number : 100 - 0040A 3 , 96 - 0408B ) and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki .
All patients provided written informed consent .
The registration of our cohort at Clinical Trials.gov was delayed by administrative issues ( set up of Core Lab , employment of research assistance ) .
The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this drug / intervention were registered .

MPE : multidisciplinary predialysis education .
The MPE program was implemented in May 2006 at the Keelung Center .
The team comprised a nurse for case management , social workers , dietitians , hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis patient volunteers and 10 nephrologists .
The program consisted of an integrated course involving individual lectures on renal health , delivered by the case - management nurse , according to the guidelines given in a standardized instruction booklet .
The lectures focused on nutrition , lifestyle , nephrotoxin avoidance , dietary principles , and pharmacological regimens .
Furthermore , the case - management nurse contacted the patients to ensure timely follow - up .
Standardized interactive educational sessions were periodically conducted wherein all patients were interviewed depending on their CKD stage , determined earlier by using the NKF / DOQI guideline .
Stage III or IV CKD patients were followed up every 3 months , and stage V CKD patients were followed up on a monthly basis .
For stage III CKD patients , the program consisted of lectures on healthy renal function , the clinical presentation of uremia , risk factors and complications associated with renal progression , and an introduction to the various renal replacement therapies ( i.e. , hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis , and renal transplantation ) .
For stage IV CKD patients , the program included discussions on the management of complications associated with CKD , indications of renal replacement therapy , and the evaluation of vascular or peritoneal access .
Patients with stage V CKD were monitored for timely initiation of renal replacement therapies , the care of vascular or peritoneal access , dialysis - associated complications , and registration for inclusion in the renal transplantation waiting list .
All patients received dietary counseling biannually from a dietitian .
In addition , the case - management nurse often contacted the participants by telephone to encourage them to inform their nephrologists of their symptoms and to reinforce the importance of medical visits .
The MPE program was discontinued once renal replacement therapies were initiated for these patients .
The same group of nephrologists instructed all participants about renal function , the evaluation of laboratory data , and clinical indicators of chronic renal failure , as well as about the strategies for its management and treatment .
Furthermore , the nephrologists explained the general principles of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis when the patients exhibited an eGFR of < 30 formtok m − 2 ( stage IV CKD ) .
All patients were provided with written instructions .
The nephrologists evaluated the comorbidity factors influencing each patient ' s condition before referral to a nurse specializing in hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis .
The nursing staff provided instructions for daily living and explained the criteria used for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis selection , and the difference between the two modalities .
Descriptive statistics were expressed as the mean ( standard deviation ) or median ( interquartile range ) .
Discrete variables were presented in terms of frequencies and percentages .
The normality of numerical variables was tested using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov method , and an appropriate transformation was considered before statistical testing .
The Student t - test or Mann - Whitney U - test was applied to compare mean or median values among the groups .
The association between categorical variables was analyzed by using the χ 2 test .
Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to calculate the unstandardized coefficients associated with MPE in both inpatient and total medical cost .
All statistical tests were two - tailed , and a p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
Data were analyzed by using SPSS 17.0 for Windows XP ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
We conducted a cross - sectional study at the Michael E .
DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( MEDVAMC ) in Houston , TX from February 15 , 2008 to August 20 , 2013 to examine risk factors for BE [25] .
In brief , we invited ( 1 ) consecutive eligible patients who were scheduled for an elective esophagastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) at MEDVAMC to participate in the study ; and ( 2 ) randomly selected patients eligible for screening colonoscopy from seven selected primary care clinics at the same hospital , who underwent the study EGD at the same time as their screening colonoscopy .
All study participants had to be 40 - 80 years of age ( and 50 - 80 years for primary care patients ) and undergo a study upper endoscopy .
The lower age limit in the primary care group was 50 as this is the age when screening colonoscopy is recommended to commence .
The purpose of enrolling patients seen in primary care was to obtain controls without BE from the source population for BE cases at the Houston VA .
These controls represent patients , who , if they had BE , would be diagnosed with BE at the Houston VA .
None of primary care patients were primarily referred for EGD .
The patients from endoscopy clinics are symptomatic and are typically undergoing an EGD to rule out BE .
The same eligibility criteria were used for both groups .
Patients with a previous history of gastroesophageal surgery , previous diagnosis of cancer ( esophageal , lung , liver , colon , breast or stomach ) , currently taking anticoagulants , with significant liver disease ( as indicated by platelet count < 70,000 / mL , ascites , or known gastroesophageal varices ) , or a history of major stroke or mental disorder were ineligible for the study .
Among eligible patients in the elective EGD group , 70 % completed the study ( underwent the study EGD and completed the study questionnaire ) .
In the primary care group , 43 % of eligible patients completed the study ; however among patients who actually underwent their colonoscopy , 85 % completed the study EGD and questionnaire .
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Baylor College of Medicine ( Board 4 for protocol H - 21436 ) and the Office of Research and Development at MEDVAMC .
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to being interviewed for the study .
All study participants underwent the study EGD with systematic recording of suspected BE [26] , hiatus hernia ( absent , < 3 cm , and ≥ 3 cm ) , and the Hill et al [27] classification of the gastroesophageal flap valve in the retroflexed endoscopic view ( score range , 1 - 4 ) .
At least one targeted biopsy specimen was taken from suspected BE areas using jumbo biopsy forceps .
BE length was determined by the Prague CM classification [26] .
We performed gastric mapping by taking 7 mucosal biopsy samples from the antrum ( from the greater and lesser curvatures ) , the corpus ( from the distal greater , distal lesser , proximal greater , and proximal lesser curvatures ) , and the cardia [28] .
For the current analysis , we performed additional review of the study histopathology reports and the electronic medical record for each study participant to define their BE cases status .
For the overall analysis , we included 329 patients with BE .
Where possible , we defined BE cases according to long - ( ≥ 3 cm ) ( n = 118 ) vs . short - segment ( < 3 cm ) BE ( n = 200 ) , and newly diagnosed BE ( first evidence of BE on study EGD ) ( n = 208 ) vs . prevalent BE ( self - reported diagnosis of BE or history of BE diagnosis on review of the electronic medical record before the study EGD ) ( n = 109 ) .
A subject was considered to have definitive BE if SIM ( confirmed by alcian - periodic acid - Schiff stain ) under histopathologic examination was present in at least one biopsy sample obtained from tubular esophagus .
Two expert pathologists reviewed all slides for suspected BE to determine the presence of SIM .
Subjects with endoscopy - only BE ( n = 85 ) were defined by the presence of suspected BE in the absence of SIM and were included in this analysis as a separate case group ( “ Endoscopy - only BE ” ) .
We compared 329 BE cases separately with two control groups of patients without endoscopically suspected BE on their study EGD : ( 1 ) 503 patients recruited from primary care clinics ( “ Primary care controls ” ) , representing the underlying source population from which cases arose ; and ( 2 ) 1353 patients recruited from endoscopy clinics ( “ Endoscopy controls ” ) , representing the population undergoing endoscopy from which cases are diagnosed .
Study participants completed a computer - assisted survey before the study EGD .
The survey ascertained information about social background , lifetime history and current use of alcohol and cigarette smoking , physical activity , medical history , onset , frequency and severity of GERD symptoms , and use of medications such as H2 - receptor antagonists ( H2RAs ) , proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) , and non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
Race and ethnicity ( non - Hispanic white , black , Hispanic , Asian , or other ) were self - reported on the questionnaire and verified by manual review of the VA Computerized Patient Record System ( CPRS ) .
Height and weight were measured prior to the study EGD and were used to calculate body mass index ( BMI ; kg / m2 ) .
We calculated waist - to - hip ratio ( WHR ) and categorized participants into tertiles based on the distribution of WHR in the primary care controls .
H . pylori positivity was defined if organisms were seen on histopathology from any study gastric biopsy site , or if review of the medical record showed a previous positive biopsy , presence of serum antibodies , or treatment received .
We examined and graded gastric biopsies for features of active and chronic gastritis and gastric atrophy according to the standardized operative link for gastritis assessment system [29] , which uses the updated Sydney System [28] .
A score of ≥ 1 on any biopsy from either the antrum or corpus was considered gastritis .
Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease : We ascertained a history of GERD symptoms using a slightly modified version of the validated Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire [30] .
We asked participants about experience of heartburn ( “ a burning pain or discomfort behind the breastbone in your chest ” ) or acid regurgitation ( “ a bitter or sour - tasting fluid coming up into your throat or mouth ” ) ; positive responses to these initial screening questions elicited further questions about age at onset of symptoms and frequency of symptoms at ages 10 - 19 , 20 - 29 , 30 - 49 , and 50 - 79 years , as applicable , on a five - point ordinal scale [4] .
We defined participants as never having had GERD symptoms if they reported no symptoms of heartburn or acid regurgitation at all age periods ; for all other participants , frequency and severity of GERD symptoms were equal to their highest reported frequency ( and severity ) of either heartburn or acid regurgitation .
We defined “ frequent symptoms ” as those occurring at least weekly .
Cumulative GERD symptom duration ( years ) was defined as the total number of years from age 10 to age at study recruitment in which a participant had frequent GERD symptoms , and was calculated by summing all age intervals where at least weekly GERD symptoms were reported .
Chi - square tests were used to examine differences between groups for categorical variables and t - tests were used for continuous variables .
We calculated odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for associations between an exposure variable of interest and the risk of BE using unconditional multivariate logistic regression models .
All models were adjusted for age ( 40 - 50 , 50 - < 60 , 60 - < 70 , 70 - 80 years ) , sex and race / ethnicity ( white , black , other ) .
Statistical significance was determined at α = 0.05 , and all tests for statistical significance were two - sided .
All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) .
Background
In acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , lung recruitment maneuvers can recruit collapsed alveoli in gravity - dependent lung regions , improving the homogeneity of ventilation distribution .
This study used electrical impedance tomography to investigate the physiological effects of different recruitment maneuvers for alveolar recruitment in a pig model of ARDS .
Methods
ARDS was induced in ten healthy male pigs with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage until the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen ( PaO ) of fraction of inspired oxygen ( P / F ) was < 100 mmHg and remained stable for 30 min ( T ) .
ARDS pigs underwent three sequential recruitment maneuvers , including sustained inflation , increments of positive end - expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , and pressure - controlled ventilation ( PCV ) applied in random order , with 30 mins at a PEEP of 5 cmHO between maneuvers .
Respiratory mechanics , hemodynamics , arterial blood gas , and electrical impedance tomography were recorded at baseline , T , and before and after each recruitment maneuver .
Results
In all ten pigs , ARDS was successfully induced with a mean 2.8 ± 1.03 L bronchoalveolar lavages .
PaO , P / F , and compliance were significantly improved after recruitment with sustained inflation , increments of PEEP or PCV ( all p < 0.05 ) , and there were no significant differences between maneuvers .
Global inhomogeneity index significantly decreased after recruitment with sustained inflation , increments of PEEP , or PCV .
There were no significant differences in global inhomogeneity before or after recruitment with the different maneuvers .
The decrease in global inhomogeneity index ( Δ GI ) was significantly greater after recruitment with increments of PEEP compared to sustained inflation ( p = 0.023 ) , but there was no significant difference in Δ GI between increments of PEEP and PCV or between sustained inflation and PCV .
Conclusion
Sustained inflation , increments of PEEP , and PCV increased oxygenation , and regional and global compliance of the respiratory system , and decreased inhomogeneous gas distribution in ARDS pigs .
Increments of PEEP significantly improved inhomogeneity of the lung compared to sustained inflation , while there was no difference between increments of PEEP and PCV or between sustained inflation and PCV .
Background
Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a decrease in functional lung size [1] .
The pathophysiology of ARDS includes diffuse alveolar collapse [2] and acute exudative lesions distributed in a gravitationally dependent gradient [3] .
Although this disease was first defined almost 50 years ago , the hospital mortality rate for patients with severe ARDS remains high , estimated at 46 % [4] .
Lung recruitment maneuvers , including sustained inflation , increments of positive end - expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , and pressure - controlled ventilation ( PCV ) , can improve oxygenation and increase respiratory system compliance in patients with ARDS .
Recruitment maneuvers can recruit collapsed alveoli in gravity - dependent lung regions and improve the homogeneity of ventilation distribution , but may cause alveolar overdistention and lead to ventilator - associated lung injury in non - dependent regions [5] .
A randomized controlled trial showed that sustained inflation and PCV improved the arterial partial pressure of oxygen ( PaO ) / fraction of inspired oxygen ( FiO ) ( P / F ) in 40 patients with ARDS , and the P / F was significantly increased after PCV compared to sustained inflation [6] .
However , dynamic regional information on changes in lung ventilation after recruitment maneuvers has not been reported .
Recruitment and overdistention during lung recruitment have been evaluated by chest X - ray , computed tomography , and lung ultrasound .
Electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) is a non - invasive , radiation - free technique that can be used for bedside monitoring of lung tissue aeration during breathing .
EIT allows semi - continuous , real - time measurement of changes in electrical resistivity within lung tissue and provides information on regional ventilation distributions [ 7 , 8 ] .
Domenighetti [9] reported that EIT can be used to measure impedance changes and assess regional ventilation distribution during tidal breathing .
The EIT - based global inhomogeneity index has been developed as a tool to quantify tidal volume ( Vt ) distribution within the lung [10] .
Previous research has focused on the effect of recruitment maneuvers on gas exchange and hemodynamics .
Literature describing the influence of recruitment maneuvers on global inhomogeneity and regional ventilation distribution is scarce .
This study used EIT to investigate the physiological effects of different recruitment maneuvers that achieve the same maximum pressure for alveolar recruitment in a porcine model of ARDS .
Findings may inform clinical decision - making around recruitment maneuvers while minimizing the risk of barotrauma in individuals with ARDS .
Methods
The protocol for this study was approved by the Science and Technological Committee and the Animal Use and Care Committee of the University School of Medicine , Nanjing , China .
Domestic pigs ( Sus scrofa domesticus ) were purchased from a local farmer ( Qinglongshan animal breeding farm , JiangShu , China ) .
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidance for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [11] .
Animal preparation
Pigs were housed on straw in a cage and fed with a standard diet [12] .
Prior to the study , the animals were fasted overnight .
Ten healthy male pigs ( body weight 50.3 ± 1.5 kg ) were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride ( 3 mg / kg ) , atropine ( 2 mg / kg ) and fentanyl citrate ( 2 mg / kg ) and an intravenous infusion of propofol ( 1 - 2 mg / kg · h ) , fentanyl citrate ( 0.5 - 1 μ g / kg · h ) , midazolam ( 0.1 mg / kg · h ) , and atracurium ( 0.4 mg / kg · h ) and placed in the supine position on a thermo - regulated operating table .
During surgery , pigs received balanced electrolyte solution ( 5 ml / kg / h ) , pigs ’ body temperature was maintained at 37.5 ° C , and pigs ’ mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) was maintained > 60 mmHg with rapid infusions of 0.9 % saline ( 20 ml / kg ) , as needed .
Following anesthesia , tracheotomy was performed , and pigs were mechanically ventilated ( Servo - i ventilator , Solna , Sweden ) using volume - control mode at a Vt of 6 mL / kg , a respiratory rate of 30 breaths / min , FiO of 1.0 , a inspiration - to - expiration time ratio ( I : E ) of 1 : 2 , and PEEP of 5 cmHO .
Arterial blood samples were collected using a thermistor - tipped Pulse Contour Cardiac Output ( PiCCO ) catheter ( Pulsion Medical System , Munich , Germany ) inserted in the right femoral artery .
Central venous pressure ( CVP ) and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ( PAWP ) were measured using a Swan - Ganz catheter ( Arrow International , Reading , PA , USA ) inserted in the internal jugular vein .
Cardiac output was measured with the Swan - Ganz catheter , and MAP was monitored with the PiCCO catheter .
Experiment protocol
Baseline measurements ( T ) were made after pigs had stabilized for 30 min .
Subsequently , a pig model of ARDS was established using bilateral lung lavage with isotonic saline ( 30 ml / kg ; 38 ° C ) infused through a funnel .
Negative pressure was applied to the proximal portion of an endotracheal tube to remove excessive fluid .
Alveolar lavage was repeated every 10 min until the P / F ratio decreased to less than 100 mmHg and remained stable for 30 min ( T ) ; then , FiO was set at 0.4 .
ARDS pigs underwent three sequential recruitment maneuvers , including sustained inflation , increments of PEEP and PCV applied in random order according to a random number table , with 30 mins at a PEEP of 5 cmHO between maneuvers ( Fig [1] . ) .
Circulatory and lung mechanics recovered in 30 min after recruitment maneuvers [13] and a PEEP of 5 cmHO represented physiologic PEEP .
Sustained inflation was performed using continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) held at 40 cmHO for 40 s [14] .
For increments of PEEP , PEEP was increased from 5 cmHO to a maximum of 40 cmHO in 5 cmHO increments , with each increment lasting 30 s , and retuned to 5 cmHO in the reverse process .
For PCV , peak pressure was 40 cmHO , inspiratory to expiratory ratio was 1 : 2 , and PEEP was 20 cmHO for 2 min .
For increments of PEEP and PCV , respiratory rate was set to 30 breaths / min .
Respiratory mechanics , hemodynamic parameters , arterial blood gas , and EIT were recorded at T , T , and before and after each recruitment maneuver .
MAP , CVP , and PAWP were monitored using calibrated pressure transducers .
Blood gases were evaluated with an automated blood gas analyser ( Nova M ; Nova Biomedical , Waltham , MA , USA ) .
EIT measurements and analysis
EIT measurements ( PulmoVista 500 ; Drager Medical GmbH , Lubeck , Germany ) were performed for 3 min each at T , T , and before and after each recruitment maneuver as previously described [15] .
EIT data were generated by applying small alternate electrical currents through 16 electrodes located equidistant apart on a belt positioned around the pigs ’ thorax , 5 cm above the xyphoid process .
A reference electrocardiogram ( ECG ) electrode was positioned on the abdomen .
Current applications and voltage measurements were automatically selected to be compatible with the image reconstruction algorithm .
The images were continuously recorded and reconstructed at 40 Hz ( Draeger EIT Data Analysis Tool 6.1 ) .
Four regions of interests ( ROI ) of the same size and shape consisting of contiguous pixels were identified within EIT images obtained during tidal breathing .
A cross section of the lung ( ventral to dorsal ) was divided into four equal parts , namely ROI 1 , ROI 2 , ROI 3 and ROI 4 .
The upper quarter corresponded to ROI 1 and the second quarter from the top to the bottom corresponded to ROI 2 .
The third quarter and the fourth quarter respectively corresponded to ROI 3 and ROI 4 .
ROI 1 and 2 correspond to non - dependent regions and ROI 3 and 4 correspond to gravity - dependent regions ( Additional file [1] ) [16] .
For each breathing cycle , the impedance change of the lung was calculated as the impedance difference between end - inspiration and end - expiration of the transverse section image .
∆ Z was defined as the impedance change of an ROI [5] .
EIT - estimated regional compliance was calculated as ∆ Z / driving pressure [17] .
Tidal volume distribution within the lung was quantified using the global inhomogeneity index , as previously described [18] , and analysis of the global inhomogeneity index was performed using customized software developed by Zhao ( evaluation _ perfusion.exe ) .
For each breathing cycle , the median value of a tidal image , in which each pixel represented the difference in impedance between end - inspiration and end - expiration , was calculated .
The absolute difference between the median value and every pixel value was summed to indicate the variation in the Vt distribution .
The global inhomogeneity index was adjusted by normalization to the sum of the impedance values .
A smaller global inhomogeneity index represented a more homogeneous distribution , and a larger global inhomogeneity index indicated a more inhomogeneous ventilation .
The decrease in global inhomogeneity index ( Δ GI ) with each recruitment maneuver was calculated as the difference in global inhomogeneity index before and after recruitment .
General anesthesia was maintained throughout the study .
After completion of the experiments , the animals were in deep anesthesia with propofol ( 2 mg / kg · h ) , fentanyl citrate ( 1 μ g / kg · h ) , midazolam ( 0.1 mg / kg · h ) , and atracurium ( 0.4 mg / kg · h ) .
They were euthanized by a bolus injection of thiopental ( 0.1 g / kg ) intravenously .
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v 20 ( Chicago , IL , USA ) .
Differences in global inhomogeneity and changes in global and regional end - expiratory lung impedance among different recruitment maneuvers were investigated .
Comparisons were made between values obtained before and after each recruitment maneuver .
For non - normally distributed data , results are expressed as median and interquartile range , and comparisons were made with the Wilcoxon rank test .
For data that was normally distributed , results are expressed as mean and standard deviation , and comparisons were made with paired samples t tests and Bonferroni correction .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
Results
In all ten pigs , ARDS was successfully induced with a mean 2.8 ± 1.03 L ( 2800 ± 1032.80 ml ) bronchoalveolar lavages .
Mean P / F was significantly decreased after the final lavage ( 81.69 ± 55.79 mmHg ) compared to baseline ( 362.48 ± 117.38 mmHg ) .
There were no significant differences in hemodynamic parameters after recruitment with the different maneuvers ( Table [1] ) .
No animals died during the experiments .
Hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters before and after recruitment maneuvers

PaO , arterial oxygen saturation , and P / F were significantly improved after recruitment with sustained inflation , increments of PEEP or PCV ( all p < 0.05 ) , and there were no significant differences between maneuvers .
The recruitment maneuvers had no effect on PaCO or pH ( Table [1] ) .
Overall respiratory system compliance was significantly increased after recruitment with sustained inflation , increments of PEEP , or PCV ( p < 0.05 ) ( Table [1] ) .
The recruitment maneuvers had no significant effect on compliance in non - gravity - dependent lung regions .
Compliance was significantly increased in gravity - dependent lung regions after lung recruitment with increments of PEEP or PCV ( preIP 0.74 ± 0.37 au / cmHO vs . postIP 2.51 ± 1.80 au / cmHO , p = 0.025 ; prePCV 0.75 ± 0.36 au / cmHO vs . postPCV 2.78 ± 1.65 au / cmHO , p = 0.012 ) , but there were no significant differences in compliance between maneuvers ( Fig [2] . ) .
Global inhomogeneity index was significantly decreased after recruitment with sustained inflation , increments of PEEP , or PCV ( preSI 0.55 ± 0.14u vs . postSI 0.42 ± 0.040 ; preIP 0.62 ± 0.19u vs . postIP 0.42 ± 0.07u ; prePCV 0.60 ± 0.09u vs . postPCV 0.4431 ± 0.05u ; all p < 0.001 ) ( Fig [3] . ) .
The Δ GI was significantly greater after recruitment with increments of PEEP compared to sustained inflation ( p = 0.023 ) , but there was no difference in Δ GI between increments of PEEP and PCV or between sustained inflation and PCV ( Fig [4] . ) .
Discussion
This study used EIT to investigate the physiological effects of different recruitment maneuvers that achieve the same maximum pressure when held for different time spans , including sustained inflation , increments of PEEP and PCV , for alveolar recruitment in a pig model of ARDS .
Findings showed that these recruitment maneuvers increased oxygenation and compliance in overall and gravity - dependent lung regions , and decreased inhomogeneous gas distribution in the ARDS lung , with no adverse effects on hemodynamics immediately after the maneuver .
In a previous study [19] , recruitment maneuvers transiently but profoundly depressed cardiac output in three models of acute lung injury .
These results imply that a lung recruiting maneuver should be applied with caution , especially when using sustained inflation in the setting of pneumonia .
Patients with ARDS can suffer from inhomogeneous gas distribution , which leads to ventilation - perfusion mismatching , a high dead - space fraction , and the potential for ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) .
Recruitment maneuvers aim to open collapsed alveoli and improve oxygenation and respiratory system compliance .
However , recruitment maneuvers can over - distend aerated alveoli , and ventilation at high inflation pressures can lead to VILI .
Heterogeneous lung structure ( i.e , collapsed and overexpanded contiguous lung regions ) is increasingly recognized as a key risk factor for inhomogeneous gas distribution , VILI , and mortality in mechanically ventilated patients [20] .
Recent studies showed that the extent of lung inhomogeneities increase with the severity of ARDS [21] , and a protective ventilatory strategy may not be sufficient to minimize VILI in patients with ARDS whose disease process is characterized by an inhomogeneous distribution of pulmonary lesions that includes a small , nondependent , normally aerated compartment and a large , dependent , nonaerated compartment [ 22 , 23 ] .
In the present study , the inhomogeneous distribution of lung alterations in the pig model of ARDS was directly assessed using EIT .
EIT has several advantages compared to established imaging techniques such as computed tomography as it is radiation free and applicable at the bedside ; however , computation of the global inhomogeneity index is not a bedside technique as it requires offline measurements .
In previous studies , Zhao [17] et al . developed the global inhomogeneity index to quantify the spatial extent and dispersion in the distribution of tidal breath , reporting that a larger global inhomogeneity index reflected more inhomogeneity between lung units .
A tidal EIT image is generated and variations in pixel values are used as an indicator of the inhomogeneity of air distribution during tidal ventilation [17] .
In the present study , we used the global inhomogeneity index as a direct representation of global inhomogeneity in tidal ventilation in ARDS pigs .
As the global inhomogeneity index is 0.40 ± 0.05 in patients under anesthesia without pulmonary disease [17] , the global inhomogeneity index was expected to be > 0.45 in our experimental animals .
We assessed the change in inhomogeneity with various recruitment maneuvers .
Previous studies have shown different recruitment maneuvers are associated with differences in oxygenation , respiratory system compliance , hyperinflation , and hemodynamics [13,24-26] .
However , a ventilation strategy with aggressive lung recruitment may increase mortality in patients with ARDS [27] .
The present study showed that increments of PEEP significantly improved inhomogeneity of the lung compared to sustained inflation in ARDS pigs , while there was no difference between increments of PEEP and PCV or between sustained inflation and PCV .
These data suggest that evaluating the effect of recruitment maneuvers with EIT could play a role in minimizing VILI .
Results of this study should be extrapolated to the clinical setting with caution , considering the differences in the shape of the thorax between pigs and humans .
Clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recruitment maneuvers in patients with ARDS , and current evidence does not support the use of recruitment maneuvers in clinical practice .
Our study was associated with several limitations .
First , we measured hemodynamic parameters after not during recruitment maneuvers .
A previous study [19] recorded hemodynamic parameters during and after recruitment maneuvers .
Cardiac output was transiently decreased during recruitment maneuvers , there were no sustained hemodynamic effects following recruitment maneuvers , and no difference was found among recruitment maneuvers , which was consistent with our research .
Second , the relative impedance changes monitored by EIT may have been affected by cardiac movement .
Errors in the reconstruction algorithm and resorption atelectasis could not be measured as EIT was used for monitoring dynamic ventilation distribution .
Third , the decrease in global inhomogeneity index in the different ROIs would be very informative .
Unfortunately , our analytical software can only generate a global value .
Last , maximal recruitment of the lung was not achieved with any maneuver .
Failure to achieve maximal recruitment of the lung would affect monitoring of end - expiratory lung impedance .
A peek pressure of 40 cmHO may not have been sufficient for opening certain alveoli in ARDS pigs .
Borges [28] et al . reported that when PEEP was set to 25 cm HO in patients with ARDS , producing peak airway pressures of 40 cm HO , lung recruitment was approximately 67 % .
When peak airway pressures of 60 cm HO were reached , lung recruitment was approximately 87 % .
Maximal recruitment would further improve the heterogeneity of the lung , but with a concrete risk of damaging the nondependent normally aerated compartments .
Conclusions
This study used EIT to show that different recruitment maneuvers that achieve the same maximum pressure , including sustained inflation , increments of PEEP , and PCV , increased oxygenation and overall and EIT - estimated regional compliance , and decreased inhomogeneous gas distribution .
Increments of PEEP significantly improved inhomogeneity of the lung compared to sustained inflation and PCV .
Further studies are needed to confirm the clinical significance of these findings .

Epidemiological evidence suggests a role for vitamin D in type 2 diabetes prevention .
We investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose metabolism and inflammation in subjects with prediabetes .
A 5 - month randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled intervention with three arms ( placebo , 40 μ g / d , or 80 μ g / d vitamin D ) was carried out among sixty - eight overweight ( BMI 25 - 35 ) and aging ( ≥ 60 years ) subjects from Finland , with serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ] < 75 nmol / L and either impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance .
Analyses included 66 subjects who completed the trial .
Glucose metabolism was evaluated by fasting and 2 - hour oral glucose tolerance test - derived indices and glycated hemoglobin .
Inflammation was evaluated by high - sensitive C - reactive protein and five cytokines .
Although a dose - dependent increase in serum 25 ( OH ) D over the supplementation period was observed ( P trend < 0.001 ) , there were no other statistically significant differences in changes in the 13 glucose homeostasis indicators between the study groups other than increase in the 120 min glucose concentration ( P trend = 0.021 ) and a decreasing trend both in 30 min plasma insulin ( P trend = 0.030 ) and glycated hemoglobin ( P trend = 0.024 ) concentrations .
A borderline statistically significant decreasing trend in interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist concentration was observed ( P = 0.070 ) .
Vitamin D supplementation does not improve glucose metabolism in ageing subjects with prediabetes but may have modest anti - inflammatory effects .
1 .
Introduction
There is a lot of epidemiological evidence to suggest that vitamin D has a role in glucose homeostasis , especially in maintaining normal glucose homeostasis and protecting against type 2 diabetes [ 1 , 2 ] .
However , controlled supplementation trials with vitamin D or its analogues have not been able to produce similar results .
In a recent systematic review and meta - analysis of 15 trials lasting from two months to 7 years , no significant improvements were seen in glucose homeostasis when all trials were included [3] .
The results from the more recent trials have been inconsistent .
Two trials in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) did find a positive effect on glucose homeostasis with vitamin D supplementation [4-7] , whereas three trials in subjects with IGT and one in subjects with normal glucose tolerance found no effects [8-10] .
Insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , and type 2 diabetes are associated with a systemic , chronic inflammation , where , for example , circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and C - reactive protein are elevated [ 11 , 12 ] .
Although vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti - inflammatory properties , especially based on experimental studies [13] , bodies of evidence from human studies in the prediabetic state assessing the role of moderate to large dose supplementation of vitamin D in inflammation and glucose metabolism are still relatively few .
As more evidence is clearly needed , we decided to study the placebo - controlled effect of 5 - month 40 μ g / d ( 1,600 IU ) or 80 μ g / d ( 3,200 IU ) oral vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis in an eastern Finnish population with either impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) or IGT during winter time when serum vitamin D concentrations drop without supplementation .
Furthermore , we assessed the anti - inflammatory effect of the supplementation by measurements of serum high - sensitive C - reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , plasma soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type II ( psTNFrII ) , plasma interleukin - 6 ( pIL - 6 ) , plasma interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist ( pIL - 1RA ) , and plasma interleukin - 1 beta ( pIL - 1 β ) concentrations .

Materials and Methods

Subject Selection
The Glucose Metabolism Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation in Prediabetes ( VitDmet ) study was a 5 - month randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled supplementation trial that was conducted in winter 2011 / 2012 in eastern Finland .
The primary aim was to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose homeostasis in subjects with IFG or IGT .
For inclusion the subjects needed to be ≥ 60 years of age with evidence of disturbed glucose homeostasis , that is , either IFG ( fasting plasma glucose concentration 5.6 to 6.9 mmol / L ) or IGT ( oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) 120 min plasma glucose concentration 7.8 to 11.1 mmol / L ) , but not type 2 diabetes ( fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥ 7.0 mmol / L or OGTT 120 min plasma glucose concentration ≥ 11.1 mmol / L ) , and to be overweight ( BMI > 25 ) , but not severely obese ( BMI < 35 ) .
Furthermore , subjects needed to have their serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration < 75 nmol / L .
Exclusion criteria were any disease that could be affected by vitamin D , such as sarcoidosis , or a condition that could affect vitamin D metabolism , such as kidney disease .
A two - stage screening was used , as shown in Figure 1 .
The adult voluntary subjects were recruited by advertisements in regional newspapers and after a prescreening on the phone for inclusion and exclusion criteria ( self - reported elevated blood glucose , age , height , weight , and diseases ) were invited for the first screening at the study clinic ( visit 1 ) .
A written informed consent was collected , HbA was measured with a point - of - care device , the subjects were interviewed , and their self - administered questionnaires were checked .
If the subject ' s HbA was 5.5 - 7.0 % , fasting venous blood samples were drawn and analyzed for plasma glucose and serum 25 ( OH ) D concentrations .
Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria were scheduled for the OGTT ( visit 2 ) , after which those fulfilling all criteria were randomized to receive either placebo , 40 μ g / d , or 80 μ g / d vitamin D daily .
Each dose comprised a combination of placebo and 20 μ g tablets , two in the morning and two in the evening .
Randomization was carried out by a statistician , in the order of entry after visit 2 .
Study nurse distributed the containers according to the statistician - generated list and neither the nurse nor a participant knew the allocation group .
All tablets and containers were physically identical , the allocation arm code hidden in the serial number on the container label .
The average time between visit 2 and the beginning of the supplementation was approximately one week .
During the 5 - month supplementation period between October 2011 and April 2012 , the subjects visited the study site three times : 1 and 3 months after the start of the supplementation and at the end of the study ( Figure 1 ) .
We aimed to recruit 102 participants , 34 into each of the three supplementation groups , but due to lower than expected public interest to participate and generally higher than anticipated serum 25 ( OH ) D concentrations in the base population , at closing of the recruitment window we had 73 randomized subjects in the three supplementation arms ( 63 men and 10 women ) .
According to power computations , to reach 80 % power ( i.e. , β = 0.20 ) at α = 0.05 , with a difference of 1 SD to 0.75 SD in the effect measure between the groups , there needed to be 16 to 28 subjects per group .
1 SD equals an effect size of 10 % to 50 % in most of the outcome parameters .
The Research Ethics Committee of the Northern Savo Hospital District has approved the study protocol .
All subjects gave a written informed consent to participate in the study .
The study is registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov ( identification code : https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01479933 ) .

Measurements
Serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration was measured from venous blood samples by a high performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrode array ( HPLC - CEAD ) , as described [14] .
The interassay CV % of the method is < 8.0 % and the intra - assay CV % is < 7.3 % .
Plasma glucose concentration was assayed by the photometric hexokinase method ( KoneLab 20XT , Thermo Fischer Scientific , Vantaa , Finland ) and plasma insulin concentration by the chemiluminescence assay ( DiaSorin Liaison , DiaSorin , Dietzenbach , Germany ) .
A two - hour OGTT was carried out with a 75 - gram glucose load .
Plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were measured at three time points : at start ( i.e. , fasting ) , at 30 min , and at 120 min .
Homeostatic modeling assessment ( HOMA 2 ) indices were computed according to the nonlinear function presented by Wallace and coworkers [15] .
The insulinogenic index ( IGI ) was computed as follows : IGI = ( 30 min insulin − 0 min insulin ) / ( 30 min glucose − 0 min glucose ) in the OGTT , as described by Phillips and coworkers [16] , and the insulin sensitivity index ( ISI ) was computed as follows : ISI = 10000 / Sqr [ ( fasting glucose × fasting insulin ) × ( mean glucose × mean insulin ) ] , as described by Matsuda and DeFronzo [17] .
HbA was measured with a point - of - care device from a capillary blood sample as instructed by the manufacturer ( DCA Vantage , Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics , Deerfield , Illinois , USA ) .
Serum liver enzymes gamma - glutamyl transpeptidase ( sGGT ) and alanine aminotransferase ( sALAT ) were determined with enzymatic photometric IFCC methods , kidney function marker serum creatinine ( sCREA ) with an enzymatic photometric test , and serum total calcium ( sCA ) with colorimetric Arsenazo III test at site with a clinical chemistry analyzer ( Konelab 20XT , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Vantaa , Finland ) .
Serum parathyroid hormone ( sPTH ) and serum thyroid stimulating hormone ( sTSH ) were assayed by chemiluminescence methods ( DiaSorin Liaison , DiaSorin , Dietzenbach , Germany ) .
Total blood count ( TBC ) and inflammatory cytokines hsCRP , psTNFrII , pIL - 6 , pIL - 1RA , and pIL - 1 β were measured in Eastern Finland Laboratory Centre , Kuopio , Finland .
HsCRP was measured with Roche Cobas 6000 automated analyser .
Plasma IL - 6 , IL - 1RA , soluble TNFRII , and IL - 1 β were measured with ELISA from R&D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) .
Body weight was measured to 0.1 kg with subjects wearing light underwear , with a recently calibrated Vetek TI - 1200 scale ( Vetek , Sweden ) , and height in a Frankfurt position to 0.5 cm by a wall - mounted device ( KaWe , Germany ) .
Body mass index ( BMI ) was computed as weight / height squared ( kg / m ) .
Blood pressure was measured after a 5 min rest from the upper arm at a supine position , using a recently calibrated semiautomatic device ( OMRON Intellisense M7 , OMRON Healthcare , Netherlands ) .
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were computed as the mean of the last two of three measurements .
Participant compliance in taking supplements as instructed was assessed by counting the study supplements not consumed at the last study visit .

Statistical Analysis
From the statistical analyses we excluded two subjects who had an increase in their BMI to > 35 kg / m between the randomization and the start of the supplementation ( visit 3 ) , two subjects who reported at the end of the study that they had started to use a high - dose ( 50 μ g / day and 125 μ g / day ) vitamin D supplement in addition to the study supplements during the study period , and one subject due to low compliance .
The subject with the low compliance in the 80 μ g / day group had used only 17 % of the study tablets .
After the exclusions , the number of subjects in the analyses with the baseline data was 68 ( Table 1 ) and in the analyses with the change variables 66 ( Table 2 ) , after the two dropouts ( Figure 1 ) were excluded .
Glucose homeostasis was assessed by fasting glucose , insulin , and HbA measurements and OGTT glucose and insulin measurements .
The derived variables to be tested were the change in the chosen variables over the supplementation period .
These were as follows : serum HbA ( concentration and % ) , fasting , 30 min and 120 min glucose and insulin concentrations , HOMA 2 insulin resistance ( HOMA 2 - IR ) , insulin sensitivity ( HOMA 2 - IS ) and beta cell function ( HOMA 2 - B % ) , IGI , and ISI .
Inflammatory effects were assessed by analyzing the change in the hsCRP , psTNFrII , pIL - 6 , pIL - 1RA , and pIL - 1 β concentrations over the supplementation period .
Physiological and safety indicators were changes in the 25 ( OH ) D , sPTH , sCA , sCREA , sGGT , sALAT , and sTSH .
As a large proportion of the variables did not follow the normal distribution , we used the Kruskal - Wallis test ( P ) to test the intergroup differences , Mann - Whitney U test ( P ) to test the pairwise intergroup differences ( placebo versus 40 μ g / d and placebo versus 80 μ g / d ) , and the Jonckheere - Terpstra test ( P ) for trend across the groups .
Related - Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank test ( P ) was used to study the intragroup change over time .
A two - sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for the Kruskal - Wallis test , a 1 - sided P < 0.05 for the Jonckheere - Terpstra test , and a two - sided P < 0.025 for the Mann - Whitney U test ( i.e. , with the Bonferroni correction ) .
All statistical analyses were computed with the SPSS Statistical Package for Windows , version 21.0 ( Armonk , NY : IBM Corp . ) .
The supplementation effect analyses were conducted per protocol ; as for the dropouts there were no data available at the end of the study to compute the change variables .

Randomization
Despite the moderately small sample size , the randomization yielded reasonably identical groups with regard to vitamin D and glucose metabolism - related parameters .
3.2 .
Subject Characteristics
Characteristics of the 68 study subjects at baseline are presented in Table 1 .
The median age of the subjects at entry was 65.7 ( interquartile range 62.7 to 69.7 ) years , and the median serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration was 57.2 ( interquartile range 47.2 to 67.2 ) nmol / L .
The arithmetic mean 25 ( OH ) D concentration was 57.0 nmol / L with a standard deviation of 11.0 nmol / L .
One of the 68 subjects had serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration under 30 nmol / L and 18 subjects had concentration below 50 nmol / L .
Of the 68 subjects that entered the supplementation period , 66 completed the study ( Figure 1 ) .
3.3 .
Serum 25 ( OH ) D and PTH
There was a marked dose - dependent increase in the average serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration in the three study groups , from 55.3 to 59.0 nmol / L , from 57.7 to 85.4 nmol / L , and from 58.1 to 103.1 nmol / L , in the placebo , 40 μ g / d , and 80 μ g / d groups , respectively ( mean ranks for change 17.1 , 35.4 , and 47.8 , resp . , P < 0.001 ; see Table 2 ) .
At baseline , one of the subjects in the 80 μ g / day group had serum 25 ( OH ) D > 75 nmol / L .
At the end of the study , 3 / 21 ( 14 % ) subjects in the placebo group , 16 / 24 ( 67 % ) subjects in the 40 μ g / d group , and 18 / 21 ( 86 % ) subjects in the 80 μ g / d group had serum 25 ( OH ) D > 75 nmol / L .
Concomitant with the increase in the serum 25 ( OH ) D concentrations , there was a dose - dependent decrease in the serum PTH concentrations ( Table 2 ) .
3.4 .
Glucose Metabolism
Changes in the tested glucose homeostasis parameters over the supplementation period are given in Table 2 .
The only statistically significant effect between the groups was an increase in the 120 min plasma glucose concentration , that is , opposite to expected ( P = 0.039 , P = 0.021 ) , although only the pairwise group difference for the placebo versus 40 μ g / d was statistically significant after Bonferroni correction ( P = 0.022 ) , and a decreasing trend in the HbA concentration ( P = 0.024 ) and in the 30 min insulin concentration ( P = 0.030 ) .
Borderline statistically significant trend was observed in the IGI ( P = 0.063 ) .
3.5 .
Inflammation
In the tested inflammation markers , shown in Table 2 , the only borderline statistically significant finding was a decreasing trend in the plasma IL - 1RA concentration ( P = 0.070 ) .
There were detectable concentrations of pIL - 1 β only for four subjects at entry and for two subjects at the end of the study and therefore the P values cannot be considered reliable .
3.6 .
Safety
No statistically significant changes were observed in sCA ( Table 2 ) or in the parameters of liver or kidney function or in the TBC ( data not shown ) .
No statistically significant differences between groups were observed in changes in waist circumference or BMI , in blood pressure , or in circulating lipids ( data not shown ) .
3.7 .
Sensitivity Analyses
We repeated the analyses by including also those with BMI > 35 at the start of the supplementation period , those who started their own high - dose vitamin D supplementation during the trial , or the one with low compliance ( n = 71 ) .
The results were generally similar to those with the exclusions , except for the P for trend for IL 1 - Ra , which was statistically significant ( P = 0.027 ) .

Discussion
Our study showed that oral supplementation with daily 40 μ g or 80 μ g doses of vitamin D for five months markedly increases the circulating concentrations of 25 ( OH ) D , even over the winter months that usually are associated with a decrease in the 25 ( OH ) D in this population [18] .
We also showed that the 80 μ g dose is more potent than the 40 μ g dose in increasing serum 25 ( OH ) D and that a considerably large proportion of the subjects in both supplementation groups reached serum 25 ( OH ) D concentrations above 75 nmol / L .
Furthermore , we showed that the supplementation also resulted in a decrease in serum PTH concentration but did not induce a rise in serum total calcium concentration .
Vitamin D supplementation , even at 80 μ g per day , was also well tolerated and safe .
The primary outcome of the study , body glucose homeostasis , remained for the most part practically unchanged , thus speaking against the role of vitamin D as an important regulator of glucose homeostasis in an ageing Finnish population with prediabetes .
Among the 13 glucose homeostasis indices analyzed , the 120 min plasma glucose was the only index that was statistically significant also in the pairwise analyses .
We believe that other changes observed ( 30 min insulin , HbA ) may be related to random fluctuation of glucose metabolism in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism .
Among the interventional studies on glucose homeostasis indicators in populations with prediabetes , an open - label study by Nazarian et al . showed an improvement in insulin sensitivity in 11 IFG subjects after a 4 - week 10,000 IU / d ( 250 μ g / d ) vitamin D intervention [4] .
In an earlier post hoc analysis by Pittas et al . among the 92 subjects with IFG at baseline [19] , there was a lower rise in fasting plasma glucose concentration and lower increase in HOMA - IR in 3 years in the group taking 700 IU ( 17.5 μ g ) vitamin D plus 500 mg calcium citrate daily as compared with subjects taking placebo .
Glucose homeostasis was also improved in the study by Mitri et al . , where 16 - week vitamin D supplementation of 2,000 IU / d ( 50 μ g / d ) improved β - cell function and attenuated the rise in HbA [5] .
In an open - label study by Dutta et al . in subjects with IGT or IFG , vitamin D supplementation of 60,000 IU ( 1500 μ g ) once per week for 8 weeks and then monthly along with 1250 mg of calcium carbonate / d resulted in lower fasting blood glucose and improvement in insulin resistance during an average follow - up of 28 months , when compared with subjects taking only calcium carbonate [6] .
In a recent placebo - controlled study by Gagnon et al . , vitamin D upplementation for six months with a dose aimed at increasing the serum 25 ( OH ) D to ≥ 75 nmol / L ( 2000 - 6000 IU / d , 50 - 150 μ g / d ) improved insulin sensitivity in subjects with prediabetes , but not in subjects without prediabetes [7] .
In contrast , in a study by Harris et al . in 89 overweight or obese African American subjects , 12 - week supplementation with 4,000 IU / d ( 100 μ g / d ) of vitamin D , compared with placebo , led to reduced insulin sensitivity and increased insulin secretion [8] .
In the 12 - month supplementation trial by Davidson et al . in 117 Latino and African American subjects in California with hypovitaminosis D ( i.e. , serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration < 30 ng / mL ( 75 nmol / L ) ) , the average weekly dose of 88,865 IU ( 2,222 μ g , or about 317 μ g / day ) of vitamin D had no effect on insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity , or development of type 2 diabetes , as compared with placebo [9] .
Our results support these null findings on glucose homeostasis in Finns , a Caucasian population at northern latitudes , even though we have earlier observed vitamin D sufficiency to associate with the lower risk of type 2 diabetes in an observational study of the same source population [20] .
The observed increase in the 120 min plasma glucose is somewhat unexpected , but one explanation may simply be a chance finding due to a largish number of tests that were carried out .
The increase was larger in the 40 μ g group than in the 80 μ g group , which supports that the finding occurred by chance as we believe is the case with other variables we monitored , that is , 30 min insulin and HbA .
Taken together , the evidence from the observational studies supports the association between low vitamin D status and impaired glucose metabolism , but the results from the experimental studies have not found improvements in glucose metabolism with vitamin D supplementation .
A recent Mendelian randomisation study that looked into the association between body vitamin D status and glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes with four SNPs and four glycaemic traits showed an association in two SNPs near genes related to 25 ( OH ) D synthesis with fasting insulin , but not in any of the other eleven tests conducted [21] .
However , if a limitation is to be pointed out , many of the trials have been conducted in subjects with healthy glucose homeostasis or in subjects with diabetes , and only few have been carried out in subjects with prediabetes , the subjects that would probably show any effect on glucose homeostasis most easily .
Therefore , well - designed randomized trials with large sample sizes and in people with insufficient vitamin D status may be needed to elucidate the role of vitamin D supplementation in glucose homeostasis and in prevention of type 2 diabetes .
We found supplemental vitamin D to exert some anti - inflammatory action , when a borderline statistically significant decrease in the IL - 1RA concentration was found .
IL - 1RA is regarded as one of the most sensitive markers of inflammation , as it is readily secreted by many cell types and plasma levels are high enough to be reliably measured .
Elevated values of IL - 1RA have also been shown to predict the onset of type 2 diabetes [22-24] .
The results from previous studies of the anti - inflammatory effects of vitamin D supplementation have been inconsistent .
Some studies have found vitamin D supplementation to improve the levels of certain inflammatory markers , such as IL - 6 , IL - 10 , CRP , or TNF - α [6,10,25-27] , whereas others have found no effects on any of the studied markers [19,28-30] .
However , only a few studies have been conducted in subjects with prediabetes [ 6 , 19 , 31 ] and , to our knowledge , no study thus far has investigated the impact of vitamin D supplementation on IL - 1RA .
Our study was conducted during October to April , the period of low UVB light exposure from the sun in Finland , to allow as unbiased supplemental vitamin D effect as possible .
Strengths of the study were the homogenous study population and use of two different , sufficiently large vitamin D doses , which enabled studying possible dose response .
A limitation of the study was the unbalanced gender distribution , especially the low number of females .
Another limitation is the lower than planned total number of study subjects , which was due to the need to close recruitment to allow a sufficiently long supplementation during the low UVB exposure period , and the higher than anticipated average 25 ( OH ) D concentration of the study population at the start of the study .
However , the fairly consistent results of our study do not suggest a marked change in observed effects even if some more subjects would have been included , or if intention - to - treat analysis had been carried out instead of per - protocol analysis , given that per - protocol tends to exaggerate the treatment effects , if anything .

Conclusions
In conclusion , our study does not support the role of winter - time relatively high - dose vitamin D supplementation as a means to improve glucose homeostasis in a general ageing population with prediabetes but suggests a modest anti - inflammatory effect .

The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge , attitude and practice of cigarette smoking behavior ( CSB ) in a sample of Indian matriculation students .
Methodology :
All ( N = 325 ) Indian matriculation students , at high schools , in Northern Kwa - Zulu Natal , South Africa , were included in the study .
A questionnaire was administered to assess knowledge , attitudes and practice of CSB .
Results and conclusion :
The study showed a prevalence of 16.9 % .
Most smokers ( 98.2 % ) had commenced the practice after the age of 10 years .
The most common reason given for CSB was experimentation ( 83.6 % ) .
Main influence was family members followed by teachers and advertisements .
The association between smoking and lung cancer was well - known by smokers ( 90.7 % ) .
There was very little awareness of anti - smoking programmes or organizations .
Alarmingly , there was little formal health education on the dangers of smoking in schools .
The implications of these results are discussed and recommendations on decreasing CSB are made .
INTRODUCTION
Cigarette smoking ( CS ) is a major public health concern because of its impact on the health of both smokers and non - smokers [1,2] .
Internationally , there is an increased public awareness about the health risks of CS which is reflected in the declining rates of CSB in the developed countries , while in developing countries , the rates are increasing .
In South Africa , the prevalence of smoking has dropped in the white community while it has increased among Coloreds , Indians and Blacks [3] .
The association between smoking and coronary heart disease , respiratory diseases and carcinoma of the lung , is well known .
The hazards of really prolonged cigarette smoking are greater than what is supposed .
The “ real problem ” is the long delay between cause and full effect .
Children who smoke , therefore , may not see the immediate benefits of stopping smoking and only feel the detrimental impact of CS later in life [4-6] .
The overall prevalence rate of CSB ranges from 2.37 % and is strongly influenced by culture , age and gender [7] .
In a cross - sectional study of school children in Singapore , smoking prevalence rates were found to be significantly lower than that of school children in Australia , England and Wales , Scotland , South Africa and Malaysia [8] .
The average age at which smoking commenced was 14 years .
Hussein Al Mumen in Kuwait reported a decline in smoking prevalence in adults but an increase of smoking prevalence in the under 20 age group from 13 % in 1979 to 34 % in 1988 [7] .
The prevalence rate among females in Kuwait had also risen from 2.2 % in the 70 ' s to 12 % in the late 1980 ' s .
In South Africa , Black school children showed a prevalence rate of 23.7 % for boys and only 0.8 % for girls , the median age of onset being 14 years of age [9] .
Among white high school children in Cape Town there was a prevalence of 21 % , the rate for girls being slightly lower than that for boys .
In South Africa , the smoking prevalence among Indians in 1984 was 29 % , overall , with a prevalence rate of 3.2 % in females [8,10,11] .
In the 16 - 24 years age group , the smoking prevalence rate was 21.7 % .
No figures for Indian school children are obtainable .
A survey done in Singapore suggests that as many as 90 % of children are aware of the harmful effects of smoking [7] .
They were aware that CSB was associated with lung cancer ( 49 % ) , heart disease ( 6 % ) , and that it was bad for the health of smokers ( 25 % ) and passive smokers .
The survey also found that respondents agreed that smoking was addictive and that while half of the smokers would like to stop smoking , most had failed to stop .
Among the reasons for smoking , one - third smoked for fun and / or curiosity , 22 % due to addiction , 13 % due to boredom , 10 % to emulate others , 7 % to look stylish and 9 % had no specific reason .
The study also found that 57 % of the youngsters bought their cigarettes from shops and that parents who smoked were more likely to have children who smoked as well .
In this study , it was also found that 88 % of smokers had best friends that smoked .
This study was undertaken to contribute to relieving the dearth of data on CSB among Indian school children in South Africa .
MATERIAL AND METHODS
All ( N = 325 ) Indian matriculation students , at high schools in Newcastle , Dannhauser , Glencoe and Dundee , in Northern Kwa - Zulu Natal , South Africa and for whom parental consent was obtained were included in the study .
These schools previous to 1994 were reserved only for Indian children under apartheid rule .
The reasons for choosing these schools were twofold : firstly , it was convenient for the researchers and secondly , it provided data on peri - urban or rural areas .
A questionnaire designed by the authors in consultation with a statistician , was administered to the subjects .
The questionnaire contained items that elicited sociodemographic data , information on the development of CSB , and it also assessed knowledge and attitudes towards cigarette smoking .
RESULTS
Of the 326 children who participated in the study , 144 ( 46.9 % ) were males and 163 ( 53.1 % ) females , 19 ( 5.83 % ) did not specify their gender .
The mean age was 17.2 years with a range of 16 - 20 years .
The prevalence rate of CS for the study group was 16.9 % .
Of the males , 52 ( 36.1 % ) were smokers and among the females , 3 ( 1.8 % ) smoked .
There was a significant difference between males and females ( p = 0.001 ) .
Of those who smoked , 52 ( 94.5 % ) were males and 3 ( 5.5 % ) were females .
With regard to religion , there was no significant difference in CSB between the various religious groups ( Table 1 ) .
The results showed that smokers generally received more pocket money than the non - smokers ( Table 2 ) .
Most of the smokers , 54 ( 98.2 % ) , had commenced smoking at the age of 11 and over ( Table 3 ) .
Among the non - smokers , 164 ( 62.8 % ) had had at some stage some experience with cigarettes , while 58 ( 22.1 % ) were ex - smokers .
Smoking in the various religious groups
Pocket money received by smokers and non - smokers
Age at which smoking commenced
Among the current smokers , 2 ( 3.6 % ) had smoked previously and had returned to the habit .
There were many reasons associated with CSB .
Twenty - three ( 42.6 % ) had reasons for smoking while the others did not .
The major reasons were : the result of experimentation 46 ( 83.6 % ) ; calmed the nerves 41 ( 74.5 % ) ; friends were also smokers 52 ( 94.5 % ) enjoyed smoking 42 ( 77.8 % ) .
Other reasons for developing CSB are listed in Table 4 .
Although only a small number , 9 ( 16.7 % ) said that they were influenced by family members , an analysis of family members who were smokers was also done for both the smokers and the non - smokers in the study group ( Table 5 ) .
Reasons for developing CSB
Family members who were smokers
Of the smokers , 49 ( 89.1 % ) said that smoking was harmful to their own health and 41 ( 74.5 % ) said that it was harmful to others , while 38 ( 69.1 % ) believed that smoking was an addiction ( Table 6 ) .
None of the smokers said that smoking was harmless .
Among the smokers , 49 ( 90.7 % ) knew of the association between lung cancer and smoking , but the association between smoking and heart disease , smoking and other cancers was generally less well known ( Table 7 ) .
Effects of cigarette smoking
Association between smoking and diseases
Forty - one smokers ( 77.4 % ) had tried to stop smoking , while 42 ( 77.8 % ) indicated that they would stop smoking .
Nineteen ( 34.5 % ) said they would definitely continue to smoke , whereas 33 ( 58.2 % ) were uncertain about smoking in the future .
Seven smokers ( 12.7 % ) and 24 ( 9.3 % ) non - smokers were aware of organizations involved in anti - smoking programmes .
However , only 4 ( 1.2 % ) smokers could actually name an organization that promoted anti - smoking programs , e.g. , South African National Council on Alcohol and Drug Dependence ( SANCA ) .
With regard to formal talks or lectures given at school , 11 ( 20 % ) reported that they were addressed at school about the dangers of smoking .
DISCUSSION
There was a significant difference in the prevalence rate between males and females ( 52 36.1 % and 3 ; 1.8 % respectively ) .
While there is no data available to compare prevalence rates among Indian school girls in South Africa , one study on adult Indian females , in South Africa , showed a prevalence rate of 3.2 % [8,10,11] .
This is , however , in keeping with international trends .
There was no significant difference in CS among the various religious groups .
According to this study , religion seemed to have no influence on CSB .
Given that smoking is forbidden by various religious groups , this may account for the lack of significant difference in the CSB of the subjects .
Availability of pocket money seemed to play a role in CS .
Although the difference was not statistically significant , overall , smokers received more pocket money than non - smokers .
This may suggest that the availability of money encouraged them to continue the habit .
The young age of onset is alarming .
The interest that pre - pubertal children develop exerts a powerful influence on present as well as future behavior .
There is thus a need to develop wholesome interests and avoid behavior associated with risk , such as CS .
This parameter should be of immense importance in formulating health education strategies .
Anti - smoking campaigns can thus focus on the younger age group .
The ill effects of smoking must be emphasized during health education lessons in school .
The prevalence of smoking in the study group was 16.9 % and is similar to that in White high school children in Cape Town ( 21 % ) and a prevalence rate of 21.7 % found in the South African Indians aged 16 - 24 years [8,10,11] .
The 17 - 18 years group prevalence of CBS is higher in Whites ( 34.5 % ) than in this study ( 21.7 % ) .
Black school children in Cape Town had an even higher prevalence rate ( 45 % ) in the 16 years and older age group .
A significant finding was that 46 ( 83.6 % ) smokers had experimented with cigarettes first before taking up CSB .
This finding corroborates studies in Singapore and also in South Africa where Strebel et al , found that in Black school children in Cape Town regular smoking followed experimentation with cigarettes [8,9] .
The experimental phase seems to be important in establishing CS and for successful prevention programmes , education must focus on this stage in the evolution of CSB .
Experimentation probably begins prior to the 10 birthday .
The role of peer groups in CSB is significant .
Of the smokers , 18 ( 32.7 % ) were influenced by their friends , and 52 ( 94.5 % ) had friends who were also smokers .
Similar trends were observed in Singapore ( 13.7 % were influenced by friends ) [8] and Hong Kong ( 88 % had a best friend who was a smoker ) [7] .
Other studies have shown that peer pressure is the single most powerful determinant of smoking in children [7,8,12] .
The findings in this study also emphasize the role of peers in the development of CSB .
Of the smokers , 11 ( 20 % ) were influenced by teachers .
In Singapore , 1.5 % of smokers emulated their teachers [8] .
In a single school at Thaba Nchu , South Africa , it was found that 81.6 % of male teachers were smokers .
The role of teachers in CSB is very important , because of their role - model status .
Children tend to imitate their teachers who serve as influential models [13] .
Thus teachers ’ attitudes towards CS and their CSB has an impact on school children .
It is important that teachers project and promote a healthy lifestyle .
With regard to CS by family members , 9 ( 16.7 % ) were influenced by their family .
Although statistically not significant , it is noteworthy that there were more smokers in the families of the smoking group as opposed to those students who did not smoke .
Parents invariably serve as models for children to imitate .
Imitation is assumed to play a key role in the development of behavior which is viewed as appropriate by the family .
Family members are , therefore , very important role models .
Advertising of cigarettes is a powerful weapon in promoting smoking .
Advertisements often convey messages which associate smoking with success , sophistication , sexuality , pleasure and relaxation [14] .
In this study 18.2 % of smokers were influenced by advertisements .
Research in the USA has found that adolescents with a high exposure to cigarette advertising were significantly more likely to be smokers [15] .
The impact of advertising on CSB is hardly surprising , especially on the impressionable minds of children .
This is one area in which legislation can certainly assist in curbing smoking .
In some countries advertisements of tobacco products are completely banned , while in South Africa , only a partial ban applies [16] .
The new legislation in South Africa requires that all advertisements of tobacco products carry a health warning [17] .
Advertisement of tobacco products on television are banned in South Africa but advertising on radio continues , a medium that reaches more people than television does .
Indirect advertisement occurs on television in South Africa by way of sports sponsorship .
Tobacco advertisements are permitted in cinemas where , on average , over 50 % of the audience is under the age of 17 years [18] .
If legislators are serious about preventing the exposure of the young to tobacco advertisements , a total ban should be imposed on cinema advertisements .
Forty - two smokers ( 77.8 % ) enjoyed smoking .
The others did not enjoy smoking , but presumably continued because of their addiction to nicotine .
Smoking also had a calming effect on 41 ( 74.5 % ) smokers , due to the fact that nicotine reduces aggression and decreases irritability [19] .
It was interesting that all smokers agreed that smoking was not completely harmless and yet they continued to smoke .
Forty - one ( 74.5 % ) smokers were aware that passive smoking was harmful .
This is a phenomenon that almost everyone is subjected to daily , and raises an important question .
Is there such a being as a non - smoker ?
The disease risk due to inhalation of tobacco smoke is doubled in children of parents who smoke .
The Surgeon General of the USA in 1986 , recommended that protecting the individual from environmental tobacco smoke is a responsibility shared by all , including parents .
Under the new legislation , local authorities can restrict smoking in public places and enforce it by law [17] .
This has very wide implications , as the legislation is not directed at the smoker , but at protecting the non - smoker from environmental tobacco smoke .
Environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) has been classified as a Class A carcinogen , that is , a known human carcinogen [20] .
There are only nine other substances in this category .
This study showed that the association of CS with other cancers and heart disease was less well - known , and many either did not know this or were uncertain about it .
It is alarming that though the effects of smoking on health are generally known , smoking in adolescence continues .
The same holds true in the USA , where publicity made a considerable impact on adults who are addicted to tobacco , while it had less effect on non - addicted youth [11] .
The conclusion is that , knowledge concerning health risks of smoking and exposure to negative attitudes towards smoking , are not sufficient reasons to prevent smoking among adolescents .
This fact is of concern , especially in planning and presenting anti - smoking campaigns to the youth .
Research should be directed at prevention programs which take into account the developmental processes , and the personal and social expectations of adolescents [3,11] .
In a study by Battia et al , in which attitudes and beliefs about the health consequences and social value of smoking were assessed , it was concluded that for smoking prevention programmes to be successful with the youth , they must be offered more than just education about the health hazards of smoking [11] .
There were mixed attitudes towards smoking .
In the main , there was an air of uncertainty about continuing CS in the future , since 42 subjects ( 77 % ) had expressed the desire to stop smoking and forty - one respondents ( 77.4 % ) had tried to stop but failed .
This ambivalence towards smoking among the youth , is a troubling problem .
In adults , there is always a desire to stop .
Smoking in adults is socially acceptable , while it is prohibited in childhood .
Adolescence is a transitional period in which childhood prohibitions are shed , and adult behavior becomes incorporated .
Smoking can perhaps be viewed as a part of this progression into adulthood [11] .
While smoking remains socially acceptable , children will see no harm in CSB .
Only when smoking becomes a socially unacceptable behavior in adults , will young smokers be motivated to change their habits .
There was hardly any awareness of organizations or groups that conducted anti - smoking programmes , ( 12.7 % of smokers and 9.3 % of non - smokers ) .
The only organization that was known was SANCA .
Very few formal lectures or talks were given in schools on the dangers of smoking .

The study was conducted in Northern Kwa - Zulu Natal , South Africa , and results reflect findings in a group of Indian high school students .
It is suggested that ( 1 ) education about health be made mandatory in schools , emphasizing hazardous activities such as smoking ; ( 2 ) that there be a prohibition of smoking in schools among academic and non - academic staff ; ( 3 ) anti - smoking campaigns be directed at pupils , teachers and other staff members should be held regularly by interest groups ; ( 4 ) local authorities should use their legislative powers to prohibit smoking in most public places , especially those frequented by children , such as discotheques and sports events and ban direct and indirect tobacco advertising at such places .
Oral swabs are emerging as a non - invasive sample type for diagnosing infectious diseases including Ebola , tuberculosis ( TB ) , and COVID - 19 .
To assure proper sample collection , sample adequacy controls ( SACs ) are needed that detect substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity .
This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose .
One detected representative oral microbiota ( Streptococcus species DNA ) and the other , human cells ( human mitochondrial DNA , mtDNA ) .
Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs ( representing samples collected within the oral cavity ) and hand swabs ( representing improperly collected samples ) obtained from 51 healthy U.S . volunteers .
Quantification cycle ( Cq ) cutoffs that maximized Youden ’ s index were established for each assay .
The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of ≤ 34.9 had 99.0 % sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples , whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3 .
The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal , tongue , and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa , along with “ air swabs ” collected as negative controls ( total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects ) .
Of these swabs , 287 / 292 ( 98 % ) exhibited the expected Cq values .
In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA , however PurFlock swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabs ( p = 0.012 ) .
The results indicate that quantification of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the mouth .
However , it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally , which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab - based diagnosis [1,2] .Data Availability

Introduction
Oral swabbing is a non - invasive , inexpensive , and easy - to - use sampling strategy for infection diagnosis .
An oral swab sample is collected by brushing a swab on a surface within the mouth , such as the tongue dorsum or buccal mucosa ( inner cheek ) .
Oral swabs have been employed in experimental or clinical contexts to detect Ebola virus , human papillomavirus , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , Leishmania , the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV - 2 , and other infectious diseases in both humans and animals [1-11] .
Compared to more traditional specimens such as sputum , urine , blood , and nasopharyngeal swabs , oral swabbing is faster , less invasive , and requires no accommodations for privacy or aerosol control .
In the case of TB , recent studies showed that qPCR analysis of oral swabs can detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in up to 93 % of sputum qPCR - positive adult pulmonary TB patients [1,2,7] .
One of these studies showed that tongue swabs yield significantly better M . tuberculosis signal than cheek or gum swabs [1] .
In another recent study , self - collected tongue swabs detected 47 / 50 patients with confirmed COVID - 19 , for a sensitivity of 90 % relative to the more invasive nasopharyngeal swabbing method [11] .
Such results illustrate the expanding potential for simple swabbing methods in the molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases , and the need for additional research in this area .
One hindrance to the evaluation and implementation of oral swab methods is the potential for false negative results due to inadequate sampling ( insufficient contact with oral mucosa ) .
This problem is especially acute in the context of self - sampling as envisioned for scaled - up COVID - 19 screening [11,12] .
In contrast to samples such as sputum and blood , which can be inspected visually to assure collection , samples collected within the mouth are most often visually indistinguishable from those which have never been inside a mouth .
This challenge can be met by using a sample adequacy control ( SAC ) , defined in this study and elsewhere [13] as a molecular target which differs from the diagnostic target and should consistently be present in definable amounts in properly collected specimens .
Though standards for evaluating diagnostic tests frequently include quality assurance ( QA ) strategies [14-16] components and levels of QA are differentially adopted .
Often , reference materials are added to samples as positive controls , for example purified DNA [17] .
These are good practices to validate laboratory processes but they do not address the upstream issue of sampling adequacy .
Even among approved molecular diagnostic assays , use of sample adequacy controls is not uniform [18] .
In some cases , SACs are successfully utilized without preliminary validation .
For example , in recent reports on the successful use of oral swabbing and virus nucleic acid testing for Ebola virus , endogenous controls targeting human nucleic acids were used as SACs .
However , no determination of the amount of such nucleic acids that constitutes a swab collected within the oral cavity were presented [3,4] .
The present study evaluated two qPCR assays for their potential use in verifying whether a swab has sampled material within the mouth .
One candidate SAC exploited the expanding understanding of the human oral microbiome in order to design a qPCR test specific for some of these microbes .
The oral cavity has a diverse microbiota , with over 700 species identified [19] , yet among human microbiomes it has one of the lowest levels of beta diversity [20] .
Streptococcus is a core genus of human oral microbiomes [21] and one of our candidate SAC tests targeted species of this genus .
The second candidate SAC test targeted a ubiquitous human mitochondrial gene , under the assumption that swabs with sufficient contact with the oral epithelium will consistently contain more human cells than swabs which had been handled but not had contact with the oral cavity .
Human mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is comprised of the 37 genes encoded within the cellular organelle .
MtDNA is suitable for use as SACs in infectious disease diagnostic tests as they are always present in detectable quantities , and polymorphisms within these genes are rare and mitigated by the heteroplasmy of mtDNA [22,23] .
Most often , housekeeping genes have been employed to ensure that inhibition is not occurring in the qPCR amplification , rather than for the purpose of ascertaining sampling adequacy [17,24,25] .
MtDNA was selected over other housekeeping genes because it was used previously in studies on non - human primates [9] .
To validate the candidate SACs , a study was undertaken that was paired in two ways .
First , hand and mouth swabs were tested from each individual .
Second , two qPCR assays ( for Streptococcus species and for human mtDNA ) were performed on each sample .
Hand swabs were used as simulated mishandled swabs that incidentally contacted human skin outside of the mouth .
Such swabs were expected to contain both human and streptococcal DNA , but in smaller amounts than mouth swabs .
We tested the hypothesis that mouth swab Cq values are sufficiently different from hand swab Cq values to enable the establishment of a threshold value separating the two groups .
After optimization , a method utilizing human mtDNA was then applied to oral swabs collected by diverse methods from a cohort in Worcester , South Africa , as part of a recently completed analysis of oral swab testing for testing for TB [1] .
Materials and methods
Sample populations
Subjects in Seattle , WA , USA were recruited via flyers and emails that were posted and sent throughout the University of Washington campus .
Samples were collected from subjects in their workplaces .
Samples were stored at - 80 ° C within 8 hours of collection , and subsequently tested by qPCR as described below .
Samples archived as part of a previous study on the use of oral swabs in the diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB patients in South Africa [1] were also used for the current study .
South African participants had been recruited in clinics in Worcester , Western Cape ( population 350,000 ) .
As described previously , these samples were collected from subjects in clinics or homes , stored at - 80 ° C within 8 hours of collection , and shipped frozen to Seattle where they were assayed by qPCR for M . tuberculosis DNA [1] .
For the current study these archived samples were screened for human mtDNA .
Protocols for collecting samples from U.S . subjects were approved by the University of Washington ’ s Human Subjects Division .
Archived South African samples collected for the previous study focusing on TB diagnosis [1] were used in the current study under “ future use ” provisions in consent forms , as approved by the University of Washington and the University of Cape Town .
Swab collection
In Seattle , samples were collected by brushing Whatman OmniSwabs along the inside of each subject ’ s cheek ( oral swabs ) or the surfaces of the palm and fingers ( hand swabs ) 7 - 8 times , or about 5 seconds .
In South Africa , OmniSwabs and Puritan PurFlock swabs were previously collected by brushing the inner surface of the tongue dorsum , gums , or cheeks for 10 seconds [1] .
OmniSwabs are a more expensive paper swab with a serrated head as compared to PurFlock swabs whose heads are composed of Polyester Flock and are rounded .
These two swab types were being compared as a part of a previous study [1] .
“ Air controls ” were collected at both study sites by exposing a swab to air for 10 seconds ( PurFlock in South Africa , OmniSwab in Seattle ) .
Immediately following sampling , all swab heads were deposited into , individual 500 mL tubes containing a lysis / preservation buffer ( pH 8.0 ) consisting of 50 mM EDTA and sucrose , 100 mM sodium chloride , 65 mM tris , and 0.3 % SDS .
Samples were stored frozen at - 80 ° C until use .
For the present study a total of 292 South African swabs were tested .
They were selected based on the availability of partially processed samples , at a time point in the previous study [1] when TB status was blinded to us .
The 292 swabs came from 71 South African subjects , each of whom provided up to 5 swabs ( 4 oral and 1 air ) .
Some subjects had fewer than 5 swabs tested for this study .
Only subjects for whom all 4 oral swabs were tested ( N = 32 ) were included in comparisons between swabbing sites and swab brands .
After unblinding , this cohort was found to include 7 TB - positive subjects and 25 TB - negative subjects .
DNA extraction
Samples collected from U.S . volunteers were extracted using the QIAGEN 96 DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit protocol .
To begin extraction samples were boiled in lysis / preservation buffer at 100 ° C for 10 min , followed by addition of proteinase K and QIAGEN lysis buffer AL and a 10 - min incubation at 56 ° C .
Ethanol was then added to the samples and they were transferred to a plate column well for binding , two washes and elution .
Nucleic acid was extracted from swab samples collected in South Africa using a modified spin column protocol of the QIAGEN QIAamp DNA mini kit ( catalog # 51306 ) , described previously [1] .
Quantitative PCR
Each U.S . sample was tested twice , once for streptococcal DNA and once for human mtDNA ( Table 1 ) .
The Streptococcus species qPCR was comprised of primers from Picard et al [26] with the addition of a hydrolysis probe falling within the amplicon of the two primers , and designed for this study to be specific for four species of Streptococcus , namely S . gordonii , S . mitis , S . pneumoniae , and S . sanguinis .
These species were selected because of their established presence in the oral microbiome , combined with a limited known presence on the skin or in the environment , as reported by the Human Microbiome Project ( hmpdacc.org/HMRGD ) .
Design of the primer was accomplished using NCBI Blast ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi ) and Primer 3 ( http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/ ) .
The buffer and primer concentrations were identical to the published protocol [26] , with the modifications of probe concentration at 0.5 μ M in the final reaction mixture and 2 μ L of template instead of 1 μ L .
The human mtDNA qPCR was adapted from Caldwell et al . [27] qPCR primer and probe sequences as well as thermocycling conditions are summarized in Table 1 .
For the samples from South Africa , 5 μ L of archived extracted DNA from the previous study [1] was tested only by the assay targeting human mtDNA .
PCR technical information .
Statistical analyses
Calculations were carried out using R , version 3.1.3 .
The package OptimalCutpoints was used to calculate Cq cutoffs with Youden ’ s index .
T - tests for both Seattle and South African studies were performed on paired samples because they evaluated within - subject differences .
Results
Comparison of two SAC targets
We first compared streptococcal DNA and human mtDNA as markers for oral swab SAC .
While both markers were assumed to be ubiquitous on human skin and in the environment , we hypothesized that swabs with sufficient contact with the oral cavity would consistently have more of these materials than swabs that had not been inside human mouths .
To test this , 51 healthy U.S . subjects were enrolled and 5 OmniSwabs were collected per participant : One from each hand , one from each inner cheek , and one “ air control ” swab , which constitutes a swab exposed to air for 10 seconds to serve as a negative control .
Cq values ( inversely proportional to target quantity ) from streptococcal and human mtDNA qPCR tests conducted on all 255 samples ( n = 510 ) were compared .
Results from qPCR analyses of mouth and hand swabs are summarized in Fig 1 .
A Cq cutoff value that maximized Youden ' s index ( [ sensitivity + specificity ] - 1 ) was established for each assay .
The qPCR assay for streptococcal DNA had an optimal Cq cutoff at 34.9 .
Cq values below this cutoff corresponded with oral swabbing with a sensitivity of 99.0 % and a specificity of 99.0 % .
Thus , the streptococcal assay was imperfect as a SAC .
In contrast , human mtDNA as a classifier was able to perfectly distinguish between hand and mouth samples with a threshold Cq value of 31.3 ( Fig 1 ) .
Air swabs yielded no detectable qPCR signal for either human mtDNA or streptococcal DNA in 94 % of cases ( 48 / 51 ) .
When qPCR signals were observed in air swabs , their Cq values were always above the optimal cutoff value .
Comparison of oral sites and swab brands
Next , the human mtDNA sample adequacy control was applied to samples previously collected in a blinded study from South African TB patients and controls [1] .
In Phase 1 of the previous study , South Africans with possible TB sampled by oral swabbing .
Swabs were collected from each subject on three different days .
For the present study , a total of 292 swabs from 71 South African subjects were tested for human mtDNA .
The oral site and swab brand comparisons focused on oral swabs collected from 32 participants during their second swabbing session ( Day 2 ) .
The swabs were collected from three different oral sites using two different swab brands , specifically : Tongue dorsum ( OmniSwabs ) , gum ( OmniSwabs ) , right buccal surface ( OmniSwabs ) , and left buccal surface ( PurFlock ) [1] .
Cq values from buccal OmniSwab samples collected from U.S . and South African donors ( Figs [1] and [2] , respectively ) were compared in a T - test for differences in human mtDNA .
Buccal OmniSwab Cq values from the South African cohort were significantly lower ( H = two - sided ) than those from the initial evaluation done on the U.S . cohort ( p = 0.0016 ) .
Comparing mouth regions , in a paired analysis Cq values for gum or tongue OmniSwabs were not significantly different from buccal OmniSwabs ( Fig 2 ) .
Comparing swab types , Purflock buccal swabs yielded lower Cq values ( indicating more human mtDNA ) than OmniSwab buccal swabs ( p = 0.019 ) ( Fig 2 ) .
Thus , it appears that PurFlock swabs collect slightly more human biological material than OmniSwabs in the same mouth region .
The South African sample did not include hand swabs , however it did include PurFlock “ air swabs ” that were collected in South African homes and clinics at the same time that oral swabs were collected .
The human mtDNA test was applied to a sample of 64 of these swabs , 20 of which were collected at the same time and location as the oral swabs in Fig 2 .
Human mtDNA was detected in many of these swabs .
However , Cq values always fell above the threshold value of 31.3 , indicative of orally collected swabs ( Fig 2 ) .
Discussion
Oral swabs are emerging as non - invasive samples for diagnosing infectious diseases .
In the most sensitive protocol identified to date for oral swab diagnosis of TB [1] , ( the dorsum of the tongue is gently scraped and the swab head with collected material , consisting of bacterial biofilm and host cells , is deposited into a sample buffer ; the sample is a semi - clear , non - viscous suspension suitable for testing by qPCR targeting M . tuberculosis DNA .
Tongue swabbing is fast , painless , and does not require accommodations for privacy or aerosol control .
Sputum - scarce patients such as children and HIV - positive adults are easily swabbed .
In recent studies the method approached the sensitivity and specificity of sputum testing in adults [1] .
In a separate study , the method approached the sensitivity and specificity of gold - standard nasopharyngeal swabbing for the detection of COVID - 19 [3] .
Despite these advantages , additional work is needed to bring the method into parity with traditional methods .
For example , in one study buccal swabs collected from TB patients exhibited only 45 % sensitivity relative to sputum testing [7] .
In that study swabs were tested using the Cepheid GeneXpert Ultra using a protocol designed for sputum ( not swab ) sample processing and testing .
Moreover , it used buccal swabs [2] , not the more optimal tongue swabs [1] .
Such results support the feasibility of oral swabbing for TB , but highlight the need for more research to yield fully optimized methods .
As such work proceeds , it is essential to control for possible false negative results that arise from inadequate sampling .
In contrast to visually distinctive specimens such as sputum and blood , a swab collected in the oral cavity can resemble a swab that has never been inside a mouth .
Therefore , the current study identified and evaluated SACs for use in evaluating and implementing oral swab - based diagnostic methods .
While tests targeting human mtDNA and streptococcal DNA both appeared able to distinguish mouth swabs from hand swabs , the human mtDNA test was more sensitive and specific at a calculated Cq cutoff .
This was largely due to the more variable and higher overall Cq values observed when mouth swabs were tested by the streptococcal assay .
This observation is consistent with the beta diversity that has been reported for human oral microbiomes [22-24] .
Human mtDNA signals in buccal swabs from the South African cohort were significantly lower than those from the U.S . cohort .
This difference may reflect disparities in sampling or DNA extraction methods .
Swabbing duration for South African participants was 10 seconds , longer than for the participants in the Seattle phase of this study ( 5 seconds ) .
Different QIAGEN extraction kits were utilized for samples deriving from the different sites .
It is noteworthy that a significant number of air swabs had positive signals for human DNA , albeit well outside the threshold Cq value .
The number was larger in the South African sample than in the U.S . sample , possibly because samples were collected in more diverse environments in South Africa , including clinics and patient homes .
Human DNA is ubiquitous in built environments [28] .
This underscores the need to use quantitative methods combined with a well - validated threshold value when human DNA is used as a SAC .
All U.S . oral swab samples fell below the human mtDNA Cq threshold for orally collected swabs .
In the South African sample , 5 / 292 oral swabs ( 1.71 % ) fell above the Cq threshold established in this study .
This included 3 buccal swabs , one gum swab , and one tongue swab .
These samples were excluded from the previous study [1] .
The human mtDNA qPCR appears to be robust and useful as a SAC for determining whether a swab has been collected in several mouth regions using 2 swab brands .
Nonetheless , some quantitative variations were observed .
The South African samples had lower Cq values ( more human mtDNA ) than the U.S . samples .
This might reflect differences in sampling methods , prevalence of TB , and / or comorbidities , diet , socioeconomic factors , and / or microbiomes .
PurFlock buccal swabs yielded lower Cq values ( indicating more human mtDNA ) than OmniSwab ( p = 0.035 ) .
This finding is consistent with improved performance of that swab type in detecting TB [1] .
This may reflect a higher capacity for human biological material .
This study had several limitations .
The sample size was limited and restricted to two geographical locations in the U.S . and South Africa .
The South African sample was a convenience sample consisting of people visiting a clinic for TB - like symptoms .
Although it included air swabs , it did not include hand swabs .
The current analysis was non - blinded .
Neither human mtDNA nor Streptococcal DNA were found to be useful for distinguishing swabs collected from different sites within the mouth .
Despite these limitations , the results indicate that PCR for human mtDNA can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally .
This feature makes it a useful SAC for oral swab - based diagnosis .
The human mtDNA SAC may prove useful in the evaluation and implementation of oral swabs as non - invasive tools for infectious disease diagnosis .
A healthy 32 - year - old woman , a resident of Wuhan City , traveled to Xi ’ an City , which is 800 km away , to visit her husband on January 21 , 2020 .
Five days after their reunion , her husband had a fever .
On January 27 , both of them had nasopharyngeal swabs collected for real - time RT - PCR assays ( [1,2] ) .
On January 29 , both were confirmed with coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention .
Surprisingly , the woman was afebrile without chills and cough , and physical examination and laboratory results were unremarkable .
However , the chest computed tomography ( CT ) scan showed bilateral subpleural ground - glass opacities in the lower lobe ( Figure 1 ) .
She was immediately admitted to the isolation ward and developed a mildly productive cough with no other discomfort on January 30 .
After 2 days of supportive therapy , the patient recovered well and remained symptom - free until her discharge on February 17 for home isolation .
Our case verified the asymptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) as previously reported ( [3,4] ) and suggested that 1 ) the transmission of COVID - 19 seemingly could occur during the incubation period and may cause a potential threat to public health , and 2 ) the CT examination is very helpful for the early diagnosis of COVID - 19 because the abnormalities ( e.g. , unilateral or bilateral subpleural multifocal ground - glass opacities of the lungs ) associated with COVID - 19 could be visualized on CT while subjects remain asymptomatic ( [5] ) .
Background
The diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) is one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes mellitus and often develops severe effects that can lead to amputation .
A non - healing “ minor ” amputation often precedes a major amputation resulting in a negative impact on the function and quality of life of the patients .
Stem cell - based therapies have emerged as a promising option to improve healing , and the adipose tissue is an abundant and easy to access source .
The injection of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue at the amputation stump of a diabetic population undergoing a lower limb minor amputation was evaluated and compared with the standard care .
Methods
In this randomized controlled trial with two arms ( parallel assignment ) and no masking , 114 patients undergoing a lower limb minor amputation were randomized to standard of care or to micro - fragmented adipose tissue injection prepared using a minimal manipulation technique ( Lipogems ™ ) in a closed system .
Clinical outcomes were determined monthly up to 6 months .
Primary endpoint of the study was the evaluation of the healing rate and time after the minor amputation .
Secondary endpoints included the assessment of safety , feasibility , technical success , relapse rate , skin tropism , and intensity of pain .
Results
At 6 months , 80 % of the micro - fragmented adipose tissue - treated feet healed and 20 % failed as compared with the control group where 46 % healed and 54 % failed ( p = 0.0064 ) .
No treatment - related adverse events nor relapses were documented , and technical success was achieved in all cases .
The skin tropism was improved in the treatment group , and the pain scale did not differ between the two groups .
Conclusion
The results of this randomized controlled trial suggest that the local injection of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue is a safe and valid therapeutic option able to improve healing rate following minor amputations of irreversible DFU .
The technique overcomes several stem cell therapy - related criticisms and its potential in wound care should be better evaluated and the therapeutic indications could be expanded .

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is a rapidly increasing chronic disease that has a significant impact on the communities ’ health [1] .
A common complication of this pathology is the development of chronic lower extremity ulcers , with the diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) being the most prevalent [ 2 , 3 ] .
A DFU often develops severe complications such as infection , which can lead to amputation and prolonged hospitalization .
Every year , more than 1 million people are subjected to amputation due to DFU , and this number is underestimated taking into account the lack of a national registry in developing countries [1] .
A non - healing digital or transmetatarsal “ minor ” amputation ( DA ; TMA ) often precedes a major amputation resulting in a negative impact on the function and quality of life of the patients [ 4 , 5 ] .
A major amputation means physical disability and also psychological / psychiatric problems , with significant increase in the mortality rate , which is estimated to range from 10 to 50 % and from 30 to 80 % at 1 and 5 years post - amputation , respectively [6-9] .
The DFU has been estimated to account for 12 - 15 % of the overall financial resources destined to the management / treatment of diabetes [7-9] .
The financial burden reverts on the patients , society , and the National Health System , and considering its not negligible amount , it becomes imperative to reduce the number of major amputations .
That said , improving the stump healing following minor amputations seems to be reasonable and cost - effective .
Stem cell - based therapies have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the healing process [10-13] .
The attraction is additionally boosted by the absence of strong evidences able to demonstrate the superiority of any other specific conservative treatment or dressing [14] .
Through trophic , immunomodulatory , and anti - microbial actions , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) “ sense ” and “ signal ” changes in the microenvironment where they reside by serving as paracrine mediators [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] .
The adipose tissue is an abundant source of MSCs ( ASCs ) , easy to access and simple to harvest [ 17 , 18 ] .
Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed favorable results and confirmed their anti - inflammatory and regenerative properties [11,19-21] .
To overcome the complex regulatory issues linked to the enzymatic treatment and / or cell expansion [22-25] , a minimally manipulated autologous adipose tissue is a promising and safe option [26] .
The commercially available Lipogems ™ system is a class II - a medical device intended for the closed - loop processing and transferring of autologous adipose tissue in a single surgical step .
This technology reduces the size of the adipose tissue clusters by means of mild mechanical forces while eliminating pro - inflammatory oil and blood residue , intra - operatively providing mechanically micro - fragmented adipose tissue in a short time without expansion and / or enzymatic treatment [27] .
Throughout the overall procedure , the processed fat is only subjected to slight mechanical forces without detrimental effects on the integrity of the stromal vascular niche and the tissue itself because the device is carefully prefilled with saline to avoid the presence of air throughout all the steps .
The resulting product has been shown to possess reparative properties , particularly when injected into inflammatory or ischemic tissues [28] due to its capacity to induce vascular stabilization and to inhibit several macrophage functions involved in inflammation [29] and has been proven to have potential applications in osteoarthritis , anal incontinence , anal fistulas , low back pain , orthognathic surgical corrections , and others [30-39] .
To the best of our knowledge , there are no randomized trials evaluating the injection of micro - fragmented adipose tissue at the amputation stump compared with the standard care .
Therefore , a randomized controlled single - center clinical trial was performed in our department with the primary endpoint of assessing its impact in terms of healing rate and time in a diabetic population undergoing a lower limb minor amputation .
Secondary endpoints included the safety , feasibility , technical success , relapse rate , skin tropism , and pain grading up to 6 months .
It has to be highlighted that micro - fragmented adipose tissue has been extensively studied in other clinical areas and a number of published evidences showed no safety or feasibility concerns [ 30 , 31 , 33 - 35 , 40 ] .
Materials and methods
Study design and population
This is a randomized controlled single - center clinical trial ( MiFrAADiF ) with two arms ( parallel assignment ) and no masking .
The trial has been performed ( enrollment , treatment , clinical assessments , and result analyses ) between 7 April 2015 and 31 March 2018 at the Diabetic Foot Service in the Vascular Surgery Department of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy .
Patients were selected according to the following inclusion criteria ( Fig [1] . ) : patients with diabetes mellitus ( types 1 and 2 ) of both sexes , age > 18 years old , and presence of irreversible digital / forefoot ulcer / gangrene ( with negative X - ray for osteolytic lesions ) .
Adequate circulation ( perfusion ) was assessed by transcutaneous oxygen test ≥ 30 mmHg , ankle brachial index ≥ 0.7 , and pressure index finger / arm toe / brachial index ≥ 0.6 .
Doppler arterial waveforms were triphasic or biphasic at the ankle of the affected leg .
Patients who had undergone previous oncological treatments ( past 5 years ) or ongoing and / or neoplastic lesions , under corticosteroid therapy , with active vascular issues or inadequate lower extremity perfusion were excluded .
Eligible patients were randomized 1 : 1 to local injection of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue ( treatment group ) or to standard clinical practice ( control group ) after a lower limb minor amputation .
Randomization - sequence generation
Randomization used a paper block system .
Sheets of paper in blocks of ten with five sheets having an assignment of treatment and the other five having the assignment of control were placed in a blank sealed envelope .
The envelopes were shuffled and then labeled 1 through 10 .
This process was observed by the principal investigator and study staff .
The investigators did not have knowledge of the process used to create the assignments , and randomization of patients proceeded individually at their first post - screening treatment .
Surgical procedure
The care of all the patients as well as the amputations was carried out in accordance with the international standards [7] .
All procedures were performed in an operating theater .
Local or regional anesthesia and eventual superficial sedation were performed by the anesthesiologist .
Patients from both arms were subjected to DA or TMA minor amputation .
The stumps were closed by primary intention .
After amputation , patients were treated as follows : Treatment group .
In the same surgical session , the lower / lateral abdomen or the inner / outer thigh was chosen as the donor site .
Both donor and distal site were cleaned with chlorhexidine .
Prior to harvest , the donor site was injected with 100 mL of Klein Solution ( 500 mL saline , 1 mL epinephrine 1 / 1000 IU , and 40 mL lidocaine 2 % ) using a disposable 17 - gauge cannula connected to a 60 - mL Luer lock syringe .
The fat was then harvested ( 50 - 100 mL ) using a 13 - gauge cannula connected to a 20 - ml VacLok ™ syringe .
The lipoaspirated tissue was immediately processed in the Lipogems ™ processing kit ( Lipogems International Spa , Milan , Italy ) as previously described [27] .
Lipogems ™ is a disposable device that mechanically reduces the size of the adipose tissue clusters while eliminating oily substances and blood residues in a complete immersion of physiological solution to minimize any mechanical - related trauma on the cells .
The device consists of a cylindric processing unit which contains five stainless steel marbles , an input and an output sieve , a saline input line , an access port with Luer lock connection to load the lipoaspirate , a drainage line , a second access port with Luer - lock connection to unload the processed material , and a collection bag for waste fluid .
The processing unit , filled with normal saline solution is maintained in flow condition by gravity .
After saline priming , adipose tissue inserted in the device undergoes a first cluster reduction and micronization by means of the input sieve .
The mechanical action exerted by shaking the stainless steel marbles in the processing unit allows emulsion of the lipid mass and consequently the reduction of the clusters .
The continuous flow of normal saline solution eliminates residues of oil emulsion and any remaining blood components .
The second adipose cluster reduction is obtained by passing the floating adipose clusters through a second - size reduction filter .
At the end of the procedure , the device releases a micro - fragmented fluid fat tissue product ( clusters of 300 - 600 μ m in diameter ) that can easily pass through a small caliber needle .
The processed micro - fragmented fat was collected in a 60 - mL syringe to decant , and the excess of saline solution was eliminated .
The final product was injected radially into the bed of the amputation in an amount dependent on the extension of the stump within a range of 10 to 30 mL .
The entire process was carried out in sterile conditions into the operating theater .
The medication was carried out after cleaning with sodium hypochlorite and saline solution , using paraffin gauze with a povidone - iodine solution ( 10 % of iodine ) .
Compressive medication was applied to the site of fat harvesting for the following 48 h .
Patients were kept under observation and discharged from the hospital with the instruction of absolute rest and unloading on the limb until the next control .
Control group .
The medication was carried out after cleaning with sodium hypochlorite and saline solution , using paraffin gauze with a povidone - iodine solution ( 10 % of iodine ) .
Patients were kept under observation and discharged from the hospital with the instruction of absolute rest and unloading on the limb until the next control .
Follow - up , outcomes , and definitions
All the patients were clinically assessed within 20 days from surgery and monthly for 6 months thereafter .
At each visit ( enrollment and follow - up ) , the patients were clinically evaluated [7] and asked to grade pain through the visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
All the visits were performed by a selected group of experienced physicians ( RL , SG , RS ) and dedicated investigators ( NL , GTB , TC ) who simultaneously gathered the data on a case report form ( paper and electronic ) .
The DAs ( finger or trans - phalangeal ) and the TMAs ( up to midfoot ) were considered minor amputations .
The primary objective of the MiFrAADiF trial was the evaluation of healing rate and time of the minor amputations treated with autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue compared with standard of care in case of irreversible DFU with resolved peripheral arterial disease .
Healing was defined as complete re - epithelialization of the stump by primary intention , as determined by at least 2 investigators .
A visit was conducted 7 - 10 days after healing to confirm the result .
Failure was considered a stump dehiscence requiring any kind of foot re - operation ( revision , secondary minor or major amputation ) , infected or non - healing amputation at the end of the follow - up .
Secondary outcomes included the assessment of the safety , the feasibility , the technical success , the relapse rate , the skin tropism , and the intensity of pain .
Safety was assessed by recording type and incidence of any adverse event and complications occurring during the follow - up , discriminating the likely relationship between the complication and the technique .
Feasibility was intended as any technical issue encountered in adipose tissue harvesting , processing , and injection in the amputation stump .
The technical success was considered achieved in case of absence of issues precluding the procedure .
Relapse was defined as clinically assessed stump re - dehiscence after a “ false ” healing .
The skin tropism of the stump was assessed by a combined evaluation of the perilesional skin ( graded as undamaged , erythematous , macerated , atrophic ) and of the lesion ’ s edge ( graded as undamaged , erythematous , callous , macerated , necrotic ) .
All these items were graded ( 0 cm , 1 cm , 1.5 cm , > 2 cm ) , and the sum was used to evaluate the tropism of the skin .
Pain was assessed with the VAS .
Sample size calculation and statistical methods
The correct sample size was calculated considering as primary endpoint a benefit in terms of a 50 % reduction in the healing time .
The mean healing time for a lesion is generally 4 months ; thus , a reduction to 2 months can be considered a clinically relevant benefit .
Considering a dropout of 10 % by setting a level of significance alpha = 0.05 and a power of 1 − beta = 0.80 , 57 patients for each arm were required .
The primary endpoint , i.e. , the difference in the healing time between the two groups , has been calculated by log rank test and Kaplan - Meier curves .
Secondary outcomes have been analyzed by appropriate one - way ANOVA with Bonferroni ’ s post - test for continuous variables after normality assessment by Kolmogorov - Smirnoff test .
To test the influence of multiple variables on continuous data , two - way ANOVA has been performed with Bonferroni ’ s post - test .
For categorical variables , Fisher ’ s exact test was applied .
All these analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v 7.0 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
A multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify influencing factors , using R software ( R Foundation , Vienna , Austria ) .
A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant and a p < 0.1 was considered as tendency .
Ethics
The MiFrAADiF trial was conducted under Local Ethics Committee approval ( protocol no . 2621 / C.E . ) .
The written consent and the case report form were reviewed by the Local Ethics Committee .
The participants ’ written consent was obtained prior to the enrollment .
The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT 03276312 ) and conducted in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in accordance with the revised provisions of the Helsinki Declaration and in adherence with Good Clinical Practice .
Confidentiality was maintained with all patient records .
Results
A total of 373 subjects were screened , and the 114 meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled and randomized 1 : 1 to micro - fragmented adipose tissue injection ( treatment group , n = 57 ) or standard of care ( control group , n = 57 ) ( Fig [1] . ) .
Patients and amputations ’ level baseline characteristics were similar ( Table [1] ) .
Background data of the population
Continuous data are presented as means and standard deviation .
Categorical data are given as counts ( % )
OHAs oral hypoglycemic agents , NSAIDs non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs
At 6 months , 80 % ( n = 44 / 55 ) of the micro - fragmented adipose tissue - treated feet healed and 20 % ( n = 11 / 55 ) failed as compared with the control group where 46 % ( n = 23 / 50 ) healed and 54 % ( n = 27 / 50 ) failed ( p = 0.0064 treatment vs . control ) .
Apart from micro - fragmented adipose tissue , also concomitant therapies such as oral hypoglycemic agents ( p < 0.05 ) and antibiotics ( p < 0.05 ) positively correlated with healing .
On the other hand , the presence of cardiac pathologies , chronic respiratory insufficiency , hemodialysis , and age were found as negative factors but only for the treatment group ( p < 0.05 , p < 0.05 , p < 0.05 , and p = 0.08 , respectively ) .
The healing time did not differ between the 2 groups , resulting in an average of 2.8 months ( SD 1.3 months ) in the treatment group and 2.8 months ( SD 1.0 month ) in the control group .
On the contrary , the healing probability during time was significantly improved in the treatment group with respect to the control group ( p < 0.001 , Fig [2] . ) .
In addition , patients with a digital lesion appeared to recover faster ( within the fourth follow - up visit ; p = 0.034 ) .
As shown in Fig [1] . , seven deaths not treatment - related were documented during this trial ( 2 in the treatment group and 5 in the control group ) .
In addition , two patients from the control group discontinued intervention due to voluntary withdrawal .
Two procedure - related complications were registered ( 2 hematoma of the abdominal wall , site of adipose tissue harvesting ) ; one was resolved with compressive dressing , and the second required a surgical incision to achieve hemostasis of the subcutaneous tissue .
Both patients were prior assuming oral anticoagulant medication .
Technical success was achieved in all cases , and no technical issues precluded the completion of the procedure .
The extremely fluid fat easily passed through fine sharp needles ( 21 up to 25 G ) and was distributed uniformly in the bed of the amputation .
No relapses have been observed in both study groups .
Regarding skin tropism , no correlation between perilesional skin or lesion ’ s edge at baseline and healing or failure has been detected .
The skin tropism appeared to be improved in the treatment group because healing improvement was achieved in a higher number of patients as compared to control .
The VAS scale did not differ between the groups at any follow - up visit ( Fig [3] . ) .
The improvement of this parameter was registered in both groups since the second visit with respect to the preoperative values .
The pain reduction was mainly influenced by the time ( p < 0.001 ) , and the treatment with micro - fragmented adipose tissue demonstrated a significant contribution to this effect ( p < 0.05 ) .
Discussion
The healing of the amputations performed in case of diabetic foot ulcers ( DFU ) , both digital ( DA ) and transmetatarsal “ minor ” amputation ( TMA ) , represents a challenge .
The high burden of the disease [1] , meaning millions of people losing quality of life , and the elevated costs to health providers [9] are the leading factors pushing medical research .
The present randomized controlled trial compared the injection of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue ( treatment group ) at the amputation site compared with standard care primarily aiming at improving the healing rate in such arduous clinical setting .
The presence of mesenchymal stem cells within the adipose tissue ( ASCs ) and the promising results documented in the treatment of different pathologies [30-35] prompted our group to evaluate the efficacy of this innovative technique in improving stump healing after a lower limb minor amputation .
The pathophysiology of the DFU includes microcirculatory damages and growth factor alterations , plus other mechanisms that keep the wound in an inflammatory phase [41] .
The beneficial role of ASCs has been demonstrated by many authors [ 18 - 20 , 42 , 43 ] .
The multi - potent differentiation capability together with the strong paracrine action of these cells represent an interesting therapeutic chance to increase healing [10-13] and to treat the commonly underlying arterial disease .
The technique we selected in this trial requires lipoaspiration , which has been used for decades in plastic surgery with a very low incidence of major complications [44] .
The absence of procedure - related death and major adverse events allowed us to confirm the safety of both the lipoaspiration and the injection of the autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue in the amputation stump .
The present study provided a significantly higher healing rate of the treatment group compared with the control ( 80 % vs . 46 % , p = 0.0064 ) which was totally unexpected considering a recent meta - analysis [5] that reported a re - amputation rate exceeding 55 % following TMA .
Our results were obtained excluding from the study second intention healing and healing after 6 months , two common resolution of minor amputations .
Moreover , not all the patients analyzed in the meta - analysis were diabetics and the inclusion criteria were not precise [5] .
In the present authors ’ opinion , all of these aspects make the results of MiFrAADiF study even more interesting .
A clinical evaluation of the skin tropism was performed at each follow - up visit , but this outcome can be affected by plenty of confounding factors and several considerations have to be made .
A unique exam testing the skin tropism validated by the scientific community is not available .
The standardization of a clinical evaluation is still difficult in spite of the fact that these assessments were performed by a selected team of experienced physicians being part of our Diabetic foot service using a standard case report form .
The skin tropism appeared to be improved in the treatment group just because healing improvement was achieved with such a big difference compared to control .
Pain assessment represented another secondary outcome of the present study .
No significant differences between the 2 groups were found at each follow - up visit using the VAS pain scale .
Anyway , the treatment group had a reduction of pain in a significant shorter time .
The no - difference in pain grading could be of no surprise if we consider that the high prevalence of diabetics suffer symptoms of distal polyneuropathy [45] .
The pathophysiology of this phenomenon and the correlation with DFU is not yet completely understood [45] .
Specific publications about pain after minor amputations for DFU are not available , partially due to the use of health - related quality of life tools .
These tools combine physical , mental , and social health data including pain grading .
It is difficult to discern specific amputation related from the neuropathic pain in such complex patients , especially in the “ acute ” phase of the amputation .
Furthermore , lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are not able to treat completely neuropathic pain and its evolution has been defined “ not predictable ” in a recent review [45] .
The intra - articular injection of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue in osteoarthritic patients has been demonstrated to significantly improve the VAS scale [40] .
It is the authors ’ opinion that these findings are encouraging and probably our not statistically significant results were biased by the overlapping neuropathy and the well - known confounding factors affecting the DFU .
The major re - amputation rate was reported to range from 0 to 56 % in a review focused on TMA ( including non - diabetic patients ) [5] , and the rate reached 63 % considering all the re - operations .
Published data on TMA outcomes led some authors to doubt the primary TMA approach in lieu of minor amputations [5] .
The failure rate in the present trial ( re - amputations , re - operations , not - healing stump at final follow - up ) was 20 % in the treatment and 54 % in the control group .
In addition , the oral hypoglycemic agents and antibiotics were found to be correlated .
The prevalence of type II diabetic patients in this trial led us to hypothesize that patients taking insulin had an overall worse disease compared with OHAs patients and tent toward worse results .
Obviously , this is a speculation and future studies are mandatory .
To conclude , the DFU is a tough clinical and medical field .
The MiFrAADiF trial demonstrated the extremely high benefit of the injection of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue in terms of healing .
This is a partial answer to the continuous demand of randomized controlled trials focused on regenerative therapies that still dominate the wound healing scientific community .
Several factors were taken into account when planning the trial with micro - fragmented adipose tissue : the harvesting is safe and simple [44] , the mechanical fragmentation avoids laboratory manipulation of the product ( e.g. , enzymatic treatment ) , the use of minimally manipulated autologous adipose tissue complies with ethics laws , the immunological rejection could be avoided without heterologous and / or allogeneic material , and injecting the graft at the stump level avoids possible complications related to the endovascular delivery [13] .
The results lead us to confirm the abovementioned positive features , in particular , the intra / perilesional injection was safe and feasible in a wide range of stumps ( DA / TMA ) .
Because the trial focused on the feasibility and efficacy of a product obtained with a commercially available device , a fine morphological analysis of the injected material was not within the aims of the study .
Furthermore , the injected micro - fragmented adipose tissue has been widely studied and characterized in vitro by other authors [27,29,46-48] and published data indicate that it contains an abundant number of cells able to act through a paracrine mechanism to prime and sustain angiogenic , anti - fibrotic , anti - inflammatory , and immunomodulatory responses in the target tissue .
The number of injected cells was not assessed because it is a hard technical issue , due to the presence of cell aggregates upon collagenase digestion that prevent an exact cell count .
It should be highlighted however that micro - fragmented adipose tissue is a complex matrix that contains not only MSCs but also many other active elements embedded in a natural scaffold that preserves them from a rapid degradation in vivo .
Thus , the number of injected MSCs cannot be simplistically assumed as a measurement of efficiency .
Application of micro - fragmented adipose tissue in experimental animal ischemic disease models has shown some beneficial effects mediated by the capability of its MSC content to release vasculogenic / angiogenic and anti - inflammatory molecules [ 28 , 29 ] .
An in vitro study of its angiogenic activity demonstrated that it significantly reduces adhesion molecule ( AM ) expression ( ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 ) and improves cord - like formation , indicating a preferential ability to favor vascular stability and maturation .
The analysis of the secretome indicated a high content of both angiopoietin - 1 and angiopoietin - 2 and low levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and matrix metalloproteinase - 2 ( MMP 2 ) .
In addition , the cultured micro - fragmented adipose tissue releases in its culture medium a number of anti - inflammatory factors .
Indeed , it reduced migration , adhesion to an activated endothelial cell monolayer , and the release of Regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted ( RANTES ) and monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) chemokines of U937 , monocytes of tumorigenic origin used as a valid model to investigate the inflammatory properties of monocytes .
These data indicate that micro - fragmented adipose tissue in vitro is able to block several important monocyte inflammatory functions [ 28 , 49 ] .
It must be taken into account that the impairment of the angiogenic / differentiation potential of the autologous stem cells in diabetes still represents an issue to be investigated [50] .
All that said , the commercially available Lipogems ™ system has been demonstrated to be easy - to - use ( no technical failure ) , quick ( short procedural time ) , and versatile ( no specific characteristics in the patient are required ) .
The kit - related costs seem to be inferior to more complex stem cell manipulation systems .
Regardless of the initial cost , future publications should evaluate the hypothesis of a reduction of the global economic burden due to the application of autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue in the treatment of DFU .
The present study is not without limitations due to the absence of blinding which represents the most important critical issue .
Unfortunately , the “ waste ” harvesting of adipose tissue is not ethically acceptable because of its invasiveness .
In addition , the funding constraints and the volume of the center forced us to limit the study sample size .
Although the sample size calculation indicated that the number of patients we enrolled and treated was sufficient , a higher number of patients in a multicenter setting would have been preferable from a clinical point of view .
The number of MSCs was not assessed in order to evaluate the “ quality ” of the micro - fragmented adipose tissue of each patient , and to the best author knowledge , the optimal amount of stem cells to inject is not yet defined [50] .
Future work should clarify if the impressive healing results reported above correlate with a reduction of the hospitalization time and of the overall health - related costs .
These perspectives could have an even more positive impact on patients ’ quality of life and on the health providers ’ policy .
Further points to be addressed should be the impact of the technique on pain , encompassing pathophysiological study to understand the overlap with neurological disorders .
Conclusions
The single - center , prospective , controlled , and randomized design represents the strengths of the present work and the gold standard in order to minimize investigator , selection , and information bias as well as to manage confounding factors .
Our experience with autologous micro - fragmented adipose tissue has proven to be a valid therapeutic option able to drastically improve healing following minor amputations performed on DFU .
The present technique overcomes several stem cell therapy - related criticism and its potential in wound care should be better evaluated and the therapeutic indications could be expanded .
The problem of having offspring with inherited diseases can be resolved in some cases through preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) .
Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) is one of these diseases .
In my short term visit to Guy ’ s Hospital in London , I set up a panel of markers which can be used for preimplantion genetic haplotyping in affected families with this pathology .
Introduction
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis and preimplantation genetic haplotyping
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) is an option for couples at risk of transmitting inherited diseases to their offspring who wish to avoid an affected child , recurrent miscarriages , termination of pregnancy or having to adopt children ( 1 - 3 ) .
In this technique , embryos are generated by in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) and the diagnosis in them permits the transfer of only unaffected embryos .
PGD is now routinely applied for three different groups of inherited genetic disorders : X - linked disorders , monogenic diseases ( single gene defects ) ( 4 - 6 ) and chromosomal abnormalities ( 6 - 11 ) .
PGD can be considered a very early stage of prenatal diagnosis with testing being performed either immediately following fertilization , or at day 3 or day 5 post fertilization .
Almost all PGD centres perform cleavage stage biopsy at day 3 post fertilization ( when the embryo has 6 - 8 cells ) .
The application of PGD for single gene defects is limited by the need to develop family - specific single - cell PCR mutation test .
The very small amounts of DNA targeted and analyzed by these procedures means that not only are they extremely vulnerable to contamination by extraneous DNA , but also to allele dropout ( ADO ; where one or both of the 2 alleles at any locus fails to amplify ) which can compromise the accuracy of the diagnoses ( 12 - 14 ) .
In order to provide large quantities of DNA from only one cell , efficient whole genome amplification can be performed by Multiple displacement amplification ( MDA ) which uses bacteriophage Φ 29 polymerase ( 15 - 17 ) .
DNA from a single biopsied blastomere undergoes approximately 10exp 6 fold amplification by MDA , allowing multiple PCR tests to be performed on the amplification products .
The ADO rates when you use PCR on MDA products , are between 5 and 31 % and these results are not acceptable for direct mutation testing ( [18,19] ) , nevertheless MDA has been applied clinically in PGD of some diseases ( [20] ) .
To overcome the problem of a high rate of ADO , multiple DNA markers form within and around a disease gene can be used to provide indirect testing by haplotype analysis ( a kind of DNA fingerprinting ) , following genotyping of appropriate family members .
The amount of DNA provided through MDA from a single cell makes testing with multiple markers straightforward .
So , even with high ADO you can determine the haplotypes if you use sufficient markers .
This technique has been termed preimplantation genetic haplotyping ( PGH ) and has been used clinically for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Cystic Fibrosis ( [21] ) .
In addition , the use of fluorescent PCR allows the development of sophisticated and sensitive assays , so extreme preferential amplification can be distinguished from true ADO ( [22] ) .
Fluorescent PCR permits multiplexing of different primer pairs with the use of semi - automated analysis through a capillary electrophoresis system ( [23] ) .
Haplotype analysis depends upon the testing of linked markers within , or in close proximity to , the gene of interest .
A minimum of two alleles is required for confident assignment of a haplotype .
If you use sufficient markers you will overcome the difficulties associated with particular markers being uninformative for a given family , problems of ADO and potential problems that might result from undetected recombination between a mutation and a linked markers , since the large number of loci tested will increase the likelihood of identifying such recombinants and identify the location of recombination with great precision .
Family members must be tested to deduce the high - risk haplotype ( s ) that have been inherited by the affected individual ( s ) and the low - risk haplotypes .
Once the high and low risk haplotypes within a family have been established they can be used to determine the genetic status of embryos for that family ( [21,23] ) .
Aim of study
To expand the PGH ( preimplantation genetic haplotyping ) service by establishing new panels of linked markers for further monogenic disorders as required by the Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis Centre .
Patients and Methods
Using on - line genome databases and published literature to select a panel of polymorphic markers , designing primers and multiplex PCR assays .
Assessment of the suitability of the chosen markers by looking at their results in a panel of 30 individuals ( 60 chromosomes ) , several families and MDA products from a panel of single blastomeres .
Results
The main disease studied was Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) .
The spinal muscular atrophies are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorder caused by degeneration of anterior horn cells .
This disease has a birth prevalence of 1 / 10.000 , and a carrier frequency of 1 / 40 - 1 / 60 ; SMA is among the most frequent autosomal recessive hereditary disorders .
The Survival of Motor Neuron ( SMN ) gene exists as two homologues , in unaffected individuals each chromosome 5 has at least one telomeric gene ( SMN 1 ) and in the vast majority of chromosomes at least one centromeric gene ( SMN 2 ) , although chromosomes exist with an intact SMN 1 gene that lack SMN 2 .
Deletions of SMN 1 gene appear to be directly involved in SMA , since exon ( s ) 7 ( and 8 ) of SMN 1 are undetectable in over 95 % of patients , irrespective of their clinical type , either as a result of homozygous deletions , or because of conversion of sequences of SMN 1 into those of the SMN 2 gene ( 30 ) .
PGD for SMA is currently offered at Guy ’ s Hospital by testing directly for the SMN 1 deletion by fluorescent PCR restriction digest and the use of a single linked marker D5S 610 .
The test has been transferred across to the new approach of PGH .
A panel of linked polymorphic markers for SMA has been designed .
Some of them had been used diagnostically before were found in the European Best Practice Guidelines for Molecular Analysis in Spinal Muscular Atrophy , others were found using the Santa Cruz genome browser .
Fluorescent Multiplex PCR assays were performed to determine the het value ( heterozygosity value ) of each marker , to know the level of ADO in blastomere panel , and to know the suitability of these markers in families affected by SMA .
In particular , the use of a marker has been assessed , known to be present in multiple copies on chromosome 5 for inclusion in the marker panel as it is located in the promoter region of the SMN 1 gene .
Also designed a panel of markers for chromosome 21 has been designed .
Discussion and Conclusions
The assay developed to test for SMA by PGH was completed and used in a clinical PGD case and an unaffected embryo was identified and replaced .
The panel of markers for chromosome 21 , hopefully , will be assessed and introduced in the future as a test for trisomy 21 which will be offered to women undergoing PGD for single gene defects who are at increased risk of Down Syndrome due to raised maternal age .
Background
Trials financed by for - profit organizations have been associated with favorable outcomes of new treatments , although the effect size of funding source impact on outcome is unknown .
The aim of this study was to estimate the effect size for a favorable outcome in randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) , stratified by funding source , that have been published in general medical journals .
Methods
Parallel - group RCTs published in The Lancet , New England Journal of Medicine , and JAMA between 2013 and 2015 were identified .
RCTs with binary primary endpoints were included .
The primary outcome was the OR of patients ’ having a favorable outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group .
The OR of a favorable outcome in each trial was calculated by the number of positive events that occurred in the intervention and control groups .
A meta - analytic technique with random effects model was used to calculate summary OR .
Data were stratified by funding source as for - profit , mixed , and nonprofit .
Prespecified sensitivity , subgroup , and metaregression analyses were performed .
Results
Five hundred nine trials were included .
The OR for a favorable outcome in for - profit - funded RCTs was 1.92 ( 95 % CI 1.72 - 2.14 ) , which was higher than mixed source - funded RCTs ( OR 1.34 , 95 % CI 1.25 - 1.43 ) and nonprofit - funded RCTs ( OR 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.26 - 1.39 ) .
The OR for a favorable outcome was higher for both clinical and surrogate endpoints in for - profit - funded trials than in RCTs with other funding sources .
Excluding drug trials lowered the OR for a favorable outcome in for - profit - funded RCTs .
The OR for a favorable surrogate outcome in drug trials was higher in for - profit - funded trials than in nonprofit - funded trials .
Conclusions
For - profit - funded RCTs have a higher OR for a favorable outcome than nonprofit - and mixed source - funded RCTs .
This difference is associated mainly with the use of surrogate endpoints in for - profit - financed drug trials .

Background
Results of well - conducted randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) are the most important building blocks of evidence - based medicine and guide clinical management .
Clinical decisions based on RCTs rest on the assumption that selection bias is reduced compared with in nonrandomized trials .
Randomization improves the likelihood of balance between known and unknown prognostic factors .
However , no study completely lacks confounding factors and biases .
Bias can be introduced into RCTs during the entire study course .
Imperfect study design , lack of blinding , ascertainment bias , funding , publication bias , and many more factors could all play an important role in influencing the results of RCTs .
If there are unreported biases in RCTs influencing clinical guidelines , these guidelines could potentially have been designed on the basis of inadequate medical evidence and could potentially hamper adequate clinical decision making .
Industry sponsorship has been shown to favor the company ’ s own product [1-3] .
Earlier research on industry funding and its impact on outcome in RCTs has been focused on particular fields in medicine .
Further , the definition of a favorable outcome varies between different studies or has been defined through the use of scoring systems of trial conclusions [4-6] or on the basis of reported outcomes [3] , possibly in itself introducing bias .
The actual treatment effect associated with funding source is unknown .
Furthermore , the mechanisms related to more favorable outcome in studies funded by for - profit sources are conflicting .
It has been suggested by one group of authors to be caused by the use of surrogate endpoints [7] , but other authors have not been able to confirm this [8] .
To address the issue of the association of funding source with outcome and follow - up regarding the implementation of the reporting of clinical trials , we evaluated all parallel - group RCTs published in JAMA , The Lancet , and New England Journal of Medicine between 2013 and 2015 .
The primary aim of this study was to calculate the OR for a favorable outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group in RCTs , stratified by funding source of trials published in 2013 - 2015 , using a meta - analytic approach .
Methods
Data source
A librarian performed an electronic search to identify studies published in JAMA , The Lancet , and New England Journal of Medicine between 2013 and 23 September 2015 .
Trials were identified by using the search terms “ randomized controlled trials , ” “ N Eng J Med , ” “ Lancet , ” and “ JAMA ” in the PubMed database .
A full search strategy is presented in Additional file [1] : Table S1 .
The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines .
Study selection
The following inclusion criteria were used : Only two - armed RCTs were included .
RCTs with binary primary endpoints were included .
We decided a priori to study the primary outcome of each study as stated in the published articles .
When primary outcome was a continuous variable and the secondary outcome was binary ( e.g. , survival ) , the secondary outcome was chosen for evaluation .
The following exclusion criteria were used : Multiarm RCTs
Editorials , abstracts , observational studies , and commentaries
Non - RCTs
Data extraction
The primary specified outcome was the OR of a favorable outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group .
The intervention group was defined as the group receiving a new treatment compared with a standard treatment or a control group .
Favorable outcome was defined as events that were favorable for the patient ( e.g. , survival , progression free - survival , modified Rankin Scale score 0 - 2 ) .
Unfavorable outcome was defined as events that were unfavorable to the patient ( e.g. , mortality , myocardial infarction , stroke , modified Rankin Scale score 3 - 6 ) .
OR was calculated as the number of events that occurred in the intervention and control groups .
Time - to - survival studies were included , and the number of events that occurred during the study period was used to calculate the OR .
If the primary endpoint was unfavorable ( e.g. , mortality ) , the number of unfavorable events was subtracted from the total number of patients in the respective treatment arm in order to obtain the number of corresponding favorable ( in this case , survival ) events to calculate the OR for a favorable outcome .
A clinical endpoint was defined as events with a direct consequence for the patient , such as mortality , stroke , or improvement of symptoms .
A surrogate endpoint was defined as a measure with an indirect / unclear consequence for the patient ( e.g. , biomarkers , imaging , laboratory tests ) .
One author screened all search results and included studies meeting all inclusion criteria .
Outcome data were extracted according to a prespecified protocol for each study by one author .
Outcome data were then hidden , and data on funding source were extracted .
This procedure was repeated twice .
Data on funding were stratified into three groups depending on funding type : for - profit organization ( as the only funding source ) , nonprofit organization ( as the only funding source ) , or mixed funding with both for - profit and nonprofit funding ( at any percentage each ) .
Free provision of drugs / devices to studies was defined as funding and thus was assigned to the for - profit - financed trial group if no nonprofit organization participated in the study .
Statistical analysis
The Open Meta - Analyst ( Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health , Brown University , Providence , RI , USA [9] ) was used for all analyses .
For each study , data were analyzed to estimate the OR for a favorable outcome by the published per - protocol analyses as reported in the published article and according to the intention - to - treat ( ITT ) population .
In the ITT analysis , a single imputation method was used , applying a worst - case scenario with unfavorable outcome imputed for missing data .
We obtained summary ORs with corresponding 95 % CIs for all outcome analyses .
An a priori use of the Mantel - Haenszel method with a random effects model was applied .
Outcome heterogeneity was evaluated with Cochrane ’ s Q test ( significance level cutoff value < 0.10 ) and the I
statistic ( significance cutoff value > 50 % ) .
To also include zero total events trials in the meta - analyses , an adjusted continuity correction of 0.5 was applied [10] .
To calculate differences between ORs stratified for funding source , a z - score was calculated by the logarithm ( the summary OR / SE to logarithmic OR ) , and a two - tailed z - test was calculated to obtain a p value for the difference between ORs .
To explore factors associated with the magnitude of OR , we performed a metaregression where the dependent variable was OR for a favorable outcome and the explanatory variables were funding source , population size , intervention type , journal , and type of endpoint ( clinical / surrogate ) .
A logistic mixed effects model for the metaregression implemented in R [11] as a plugin for Open Meta - Analyst was used because it allows for both within - study variation and between - study variation .
To investigate differences in the OR between different subgroups , prespecified sensitivity analyzes were performed , including medical fields , type of intervention , type of endpoint , blinding , and comparator ( placebo / nonplacebo ) in drug trials .
Because we had a rather strict definition of funding source in which free provision of drug was considered as sponsorship by industry , we carried out a sensitivity analysis excluding studies with industry - funded free provision of drugs .

Association of funding source on outcome
Calculation of the effect size for a favorable outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group was performed for all included studies and stratified for funding source .
The OR for a favorable outcome in for - profit funded RCTs was 1.92 ( 95 % CI 1.72 - 2.14 ) , which was higher than in the mixed - funded RCTs ( OR 1.34 , 95 % CI 1.25 - 1.43 ) .
For - profit - funded RCTs had a higher OR for a favorable clinical outcome than nonprofit - funded RCTs ( OR 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.26 - 1.39 ) .
No statistical differences were found between the per - protocol and ITT analyses ( Table [2] ) .
There was considerable heterogeneity between the included studies ( I 2 73 % to 96 % ) .Meta - analysis comparing OR of favorable outcome , stratified by result analysis , primary outcome , and funding source

Metaregression
Metaregression was performed to assess the role of moderator variables on the effect size .
The following factors were included : sample size , medical journal , clinical / surrogate endpoint , intervention type , and funding source .
The metaregression analysis showed that differences in OR could be explained by reporting on surrogate compared with clinical endpoints , as well as by funding source , such as for - profit funding compared with other funding sources .
Furthermore , drug trials are associated with a higher OR than device trials and procedure trials in combination with other types of intervention .
Smaller sample size and medical journal were not related to differences in effect size ( Table [4] ) .

Clinical and surrogate endpoints
The OR of a favorable outcome for clinical endpoints was significantly higher in for - profit funded RCTs ( OR 1.50 , 95 % CI 1.40 - 1.61 ) than in mixed - funded RCTs ( OR 1.27 , 95 % CI 1.16 - 1.34 ) and nonprofit - funded RCTs ( OR 1.27 , 95 % CI 1.19 - 1.37 ) .
This difference in OR between for - profit and nonprofit / mixed - funded RCTs was also seen in surrogate endpoints ( Table [2] ) .
When we stratified drug trials into clinical and surrogate endpoints , we found no difference in the OR of clinical endpoints between funding sources .
However , we found significantly higher OR for surrogate endpoints in for - profit - funded drug trials ( OR 4.10 , 95 % CI 2.64 - 6.37 ) than in nonprofit - funded drug trials ( OR 1.66 , 95 % CI 1.11 - 2.47 ) ( Table [5] ) .

Drug trials
Excluding drug trials changed the OR from a statistical difference depending on funding source to a nonsignificant difference in OR between funding .
Placebo - controlled for - profit drug trials had a higher OR than mixed - and nonprofit - funded placebo drug trials .
Double - blind drug trials and non - double - blind trials had a higher OR in for - profit - financed trials than nonprofit - financed trials ( Table [5] ) .
Non - placebo - controlled drug trials with for - profit funding had a higher OR than mixed - funded trials , but there was no difference from nonprofit - funded research .
Discussion
In this study , we calculated the OR for a favorable outcome in 509 RCTs published in general medical journals between 2013 and 2015 , stratified by funding source , and we investigated the underlying mechanisms for differences in OR .
RCTs funded by for - profit organizations had a higher OR for a favorable outcome than both nonprofit - funded and mixed - funded RCTs .
The OR for a favorable outcome was higher for both clinical and surrogate endpoints in for - profit - funded trials than for RCTs with other funding .
The significant difference in OR between for - profit - and nonprofit - funded RCTs was lost when we excluded drug trials , indicating that a higher OR is associated with drug trials .
After stratifying drug trials into clinical endpoints , we found no differences in OR between funding sources .
For - profit - financed drug trials in which researchers reported on surrogate endpoints had a significantly higher OR of a favorable outcome than nonprofit - financed drug trials .
We speculated that the resulting OR stratified for funding source would differ between the per - protocol and ITT analyses owing to differences in missing data between studies .
However , consistent with earlier observations , our results contradicted this speculation , showing no difference between the ITT and per - protocol analyses [12] .
The strengths of this study are the large number of included studies ( n = 509 ) from recent years .
Trials from all medical fields were included to fully study the concept of funding influencing trial results .
We analyzed studies with binary outcomes , which are more commonly associated with hard clinical endpoints such as progression - free survival than continuous variables , which are more often surrogate markers such as blood pressure [13] .
In addition , we included studies with time - to - survival rates and recorded the actual events at a certain time point , because those studies are often conducted in cancer fields and often financed by industry .
Using a meta - analytic technique , we were able to quantify the effect size of a favorable outcome in the intervention group compared with the control group on the basis of actual study event rates of outcomes rather than scoring systems .
To our knowledge , the aggregated effect size based on funding source has not been previously reported .
To limit bias in selecting reported outcomes we prespecified that we would study the primary study outcome as reported in the published articles .
Limitations of this study are due mainly to the statistical constraints of a meta - analysis combining different study designs , populations , and interventions .
A high heterogeneity was expected in this study because different studies with completely different outcomes from all medical fields were included , along with a variety of types of interventions .
Also , the study design varied between trials .
Altogether , this yielded a high heterogeneity .
However , in order to comprehensively explore the size and magnitude of the association between funding source and study outcome , a meta - analysis with appropriate sensitivity analyses was warranted .
There are several approaches to addressing heterogeneity [14] .
We chose to explore heterogeneity by applying metaregression analysis and a random effects model .
The metaregression analysis revealed that the use of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials was associated with higher OR than the use of clinical endpoints .
Also , drug trials were associated with a higher OR than device trials or procedure trials in combination with other types of interventions .
Furthermore , the metaregression analysis showed that for - profit - funded trials were associated with higher OR than other funding sources .
The inclusion of small studies and medical journal type in the model did not have a moderating variable effect on the meta - analysis effect size ( OR ) .
These results contradict the hypothesis that smaller studies are related to higher treatment effects or that higher treatment effect is associated with publication ( e.g. , New England Journal of Medicine compared with The Lancet or JAMA ) .
Given the diversity of clinical conditions and outcomes that were pooled in our analysis , we tried to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics by performing relevant sensitivity analyses .
Our findings are in line with earlier studies demonstrating an association between for - profit - funded research and a more favorable outcome [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 ] ; however , these studies were based on data published 10 - 15 years ago .
Previous research has been focused on specific medical fields , such as cardiovascular research [3] , nutrition [16] , or drug trials [5] .
Our stratified analysis for different medical fields showed a higher OR for a favorable outcome in all groups except autoimmunity , cardiovascular , and diabetes , with the highest absolute OR being in autoimmunity trials .
Our study shows that the association between a higher OR for a favorable outcome and for - profit - financed trials is consistent in all medical fields .
The OR for a favorable outcome in for - profit - financed drug trials was higher in placebo - controlled studies and double - blind studies than in nonprofit - financed drug trials .
Free provision of drugs by industry is common in RCTs performed today , here defined as mixed funding if the trial was otherwise funded by a nonprofit organization .
Excluding these trials did not change the OR .
Previous studies of the association between funding source and study outcome or conclusion have defined a favorable outcome on the basis of either statistical significance [16] or a scoring system [ 3 , 5 ] .
The ORs in for - profit - funded research in these studies have not been statistically different from nonprofit - funded studies [ 5 , 17 , 18 ] .
Two exceptions are trials investigating nicotine replacement therapy [19] and glucosamine [20] .
The authors of a Cochrane report published in 2012 stated that the higher OR in industry - sponsored studies could be mediated by unknown factors regarded as “ metabias ” [1] .
There are several hypotheses explaining the differences in rates of favorable outcome between studies .
Differences due to variations in methodological quality are unlikely in studies published in the included high - impact journals , because study quality in general is higher in high - impact journals than in other medical journals [21] .
Probably , this is because many drug trials are almost consistently conducted by contract research organizations , which are frequently multi - billion - dollar organizations that have more experience in conducting trials than many academic centers and also have more risk safeguards in place than many academic or nonprofit centers .
This has been further evaluated in a study by Boutron et al . [22] , who reported on the presence of “ spin ” in RCTs with nonsignificant results for the primary endpoint .
In the study by Boutron et al . , spin was reported in studies published mainly in lower - impact journals .
Previous studies do not support the notion that industry funding is associated with inferior study quality [ 4 , 23 , 24 ] .
Our results show that study blinding and comparator group ( e.g. , active control or placebo ) poorly explain differences in effect size between funding sources .
Our findings suggest that the use and selection of surrogate markers as primary endpoints partly explain the difference in effect size between funding sources .
One could argue that the differences in outcome between funding types can be explained by publication bias whereby industry groups rarely publish negative results and drug industry - funded research is less likely to be published [15] .
In accordance with these concepts , research funded by drug companies has been reported to be subject to selective publication , selective reporting , and multiple publications [25] .
Previous researchers reported that pharmaceutical companies have suppressed studies reporting severe adverse effects [ 26 , 27 ] .
Kasenda et al . [28] reported on reasons for discontinuation of clinical trials .
For - profit - funded studies were less likely than nonprofit - funded trials to be discontinued because of poor recruitment .
Do pharmaceutical industries have a better availability of effective drugs ?
This is partly contradicted by a study from Kasenda et al . , who found discontinuation of clinical trials because of futility in equal proportions between for - profit - and nonprofit - funded trials [28] .
In analyzing drug trials , they found that there were no differences in effect sizes for clinical endpoints .
This contradicts the hypothesis that for - profit organizations have more effective drugs .
In addition , as reviewed by Svensson et al . , several drugs approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints have later been shown to have substantial side effects , impacting patients ’ clinical course negatively [29] .
In a RCT , Kesselheim et al . [30] compared how physicians interpret trials depending on methodological differences and funding sources .
For - profit funding reduced physicians ’ willingness to believe the data .
In the last decade , several measures have been taken to reduce selective reporting in trials through the introduction of trial registration [31] and the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) guidelines [32] .
The existence of industry - financed RCTs is essential for the development of new drugs and modern treatments .
However , physicians ’ mistrust of for - profit - funded research is of great concern .
Despite the latest year ’ s implementation of trial registration and methodological guidelines for RCTs , the present study shows a clear association between for - profit - financed studies and a higher OR for a favorable outcome than for RCTs supported by other types of funding .
The present study shows evidence that for - profit - financed RCT researchers still report higher ORs , despite recent years ’ efforts to increase good research conduct and transparency in RCTs .
Recently , the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors proposed the concept of data sharing for clinical trials , enabling secondary analyses of studies [33] .
In a previous study , Ebrahim et al . [34] evaluated reanalyses of published RCTs and found that 35 % of the reanalyses could alter conclusions from those originally published , were the original authors to have concluded that they were inept in their analysis , further indicating this need for an open access to published study data .
Other strategies can contain greater public funding of RCTs or “ money - blind ” independent organizations that would help to develop trial methodology on the basis of industry funding .
The findings of the present study indicate that the use of surrogate markers as primary endpoints should be clearly stated as such in the abstracts of the trials , in order not to overestimate the potential clinical benefit for the individual patients .
Conclusions
Our study shows evidence supporting the hypothesis that for - profit - financed RCTs are associated with a higher OR for a favorable outcome of a new treatment than nonprofit - and mixed - funded RCTs , and that this difference is associated mainly with the use of surrogate endpoints in for - profit - financed drug trials .
However , for - profit - financed drug trials with clinical endpoints have ORs equal to those of trials with other funding sources .

Pulmonary thromboembolism ( PTE ) may increase D - dimer and decrease fibrinogen levels .
However , in settings such as intensive care units ( ICU ) and in long - term hospitalised patients , several factors may influence D - dimer and fibrinogen concentrations and make them unreliable indicators for the diagnosis of PTE .
The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of D - dimer : fibrinogen ratio ( DDFR ) for the diagnosis of PTE in ICU patients .
Methods
ICU patients who were suspected of having a first PTE and had no history of using anti - coagulants and contraceptives were included in the study .
Levels of D - dimer and fibrinogen were measured for each patient prior to any intervention .
Angiography or CT angiography was done in order to establish a definite diagnosis for each patient .
Suitable analytical tests were performed to compare means .
Results
Eighty - one patients were included in the study , of whom 41 had PTE and 40 did not .
Mean values of D - dimer and fibrinogen were 3.97 ± 3.22 μ g / ml and 560.6 ± 197.3 mg / dl , respectively .
Significantly higher levels of D - dimer ( 4.65 ± 3.46 vs 2.25 ± 2.55 μ g / ml , p = 0.006 ) and DDFR ( 0.913 ± 0.716 vs 483 ± 0.440 × 10 , p = 0.003 ) were seen in PTE patients than in those without PTE .
Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) analysis showed a 70.3 % sensitivity and 70.1 % specificity with a D - dimer value of 2.43 μ g / ml ( AUC = 0.714 , p = 0.002 ) as the best cut - off point ; and a 70.3 % sensitivity and 61.6 % specificity with a DDFR value of 0.417 × 10 ( AUC = 0.710 , p = 0.004 ) as the best cut - off point .
In backward stepwise regression analysis , DDRF ( OR = 0.72 , p = 0.025 ) , gender ( OR = 0.76 , p = 0.049 ) and white blood cell count ( OR = 1.11 , p = 0.373 ) were modelled ( p = 0.029 , R = 0.577 ) .
Conclusion
For diagnosis of PTE , DDFR can be considered to have almost the same importance as D - dimer level .
Moreover , it was possible to rule out PTE with only a D - dimer cut - off value < 0.43 mg / dl , without the use of DDFR .
However , these values cannot be used as a replacement for angiography or CT angiography
Abstract
Pulmonary thromboembolism ( PTE ) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular - related deaths , with an average incidence of one in 100 000 patients annually [1,2] .
PTE is also one of the most important causes of sudden death and occurs in 10 % of hospitalised patients , of which only 29 % are correctly diagnosed before death [3] .
Moreover , PTE is a common life - threatening complication in patients with long - term hospitalisation , especially in intensive care units ( ICU ) [4] .
The signs and symptoms of PTE are often very non - specific and can lead the practitioner to misdiagnose it [5] .
Although computed tomographic ( CT ) angiography is a first - line method for the diagnosis of PTE , it is contra - indicated in patients with renal insufficiency and in pregnant women , and it is relatively expensive , especially for developing countries .
These limitations can result in mismanagement of PTE [5] .
Therefore attempts have been made for years to find a less - invasive , well - priced and more available test , such as biochemical markers in plasma [7-10] .
D - dimer is a degradation product of cross - linked fibrin that increases in acute thromboembolic events [11] .
D - dimer concentrations can be used to diagnose or rule out PTE but its specificity is poor because D - dimer levels can be elevated in other clinical conditions associated with additional fibrin formation , including old age , malignancies , infections and postoperative states [12,13] .
Plasma fibrinogen is one of the most important factors in the coagulation cascade and its concentration rises in many conditions , such as haemodynamic impairment , infections , cardiac , lung and aortic diseases and malignancies , as an acute - phase reactant .
Many of these conditions have signs and symptoms similar to those of PTE [14,15] .
A study by Kucher et al . demonstrated that the D - dimer : fibrinogen ratio could be a specific predictor for PTE in emergency patients with no other medical condition [9] .
However , in other settings such as the ICU or in long - term hospitalised patients with an elevated risk for PTE , several factors may influence D - dimer and fibrinogen concentrations [12-16] .
Furthermore , in these patients , there was less accessibility to CT angiography and more complications were experienced with the use of it [17,18] .
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the D - dimer : fibrinogen ratio ( DDFR ) for the diagnosis of PTE in ICU patients .
Methods
In this analytical cross - sectional study , 91 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU wards of Rasoul - e - Akram and Shahid - Rajaee hospitals were included .
All of the patients were diagnosed with diseases such as heart failure , pneumonia and stroke at the time of hospitalisation .
To enrol these patients in our study , they had to be susceptible to a first PTE in the ICU setting , and showing signs and symptoms of PTE .
Diagnosis was established by angiography or CT angiography .
The patients with documented PTE were included in our case group and those without PTE were used as the control group .
Patients with a history of using anticoagulants or oral contraceptives , and those with a previous history of PTE were excluded .
Prior to any treatment or invasive diagnostic studies , blood samples were taken from all patients for routine laboratory tests such as a complete blood cell count ( CBC ) , arterial blood gas ( ABG ) , and plasma sodium ( Na ) , potassium ( K ) , D - dimer and fibrinogen levels .
Medical history and other demographic information were collected from patients ’ medical files and inserted into pre - prepared checklists .
For D - dimer and fibrinogen assays , 2.7 ml of blood was taken from the antecubital vein of all patients , placed in standard Vacutainer ( Becton Dickinson , Plymouth , UK ) tubes containing 0.109 M buffered tri - sodium citrate , and centrifuged at 1 000 × g for 10 minutes at 18 - 21 ° C to extract the plasma .
The samples were then sent to the laboratory in a cold box .
All biochemical assays were carried out in the clinical laboratory of Day General Hospital , Tehran , Iran .
Functional fibrinogen level was measured by the Clauss method [19] .
D - dimer level was measured with a Tina - quant D - dimer diagnostic kit ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) by particle - enhanced immunoturbidimetric assay with the aid of an automated chemical analysis system ( model 704 , Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Intra - and inter - assay coefficients of variance of this test were 6.6 and 1.1 % , respectively .
In order to calculate DDFR , the equation below was used : DDFR = The study was pre - evaluated and approved by the ethics committee of the Iran University of Medical Sciences .
All patients or their next of kin were aware of their presence in the study and verbal or written consent was given .
All patients participated anonymously and their personal information was kept confidential .
Statistical analysis
All data were entered and analysed by SPSS for Windows version 16 .
Qualitative data were expressed as percentages and quantitative data as means ± SD .
Before the analysis , all data of quantitative variables were tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test .
Statistical tests such as the Student ’ s t - test , Chi - square and Mann - Whitney U - test were used .
For calculating the sensitivity and specificity of various cut - off points for D - dimer and DDFR levels in this study , a receiver operating characteristics ( ROC ) analysis and curve was conducted .
In addition , regression analysis was performed to create a model to evaluate the risk factors as a predictive test .
A p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
Results
Baseline characteristics
After excluding 10 patients who did not meet our inclusion criteria , 81 patients were included in this study ; 38 males and 43 females .
Mean age was 61.62 ± 17.40 years and the mean duration of hospitalisation was 16.78 ± 12.1 days .
The most common cause of admission was cardiovascular disorders ( 23 patients , 28.3 % ) , pulmonary disease ( 21 patients , 25.9 % ) and neurologic disorders ( 12 patients , 14.8 % ) .
Other causes such as kidney disease , gastrointestinal bleeding and complications after orthopaedic surgery were seen in the remaining cases ( 24 patients , 29.6 % ) .
In their medical history , 27 patients ( 33.3 % ) had diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , 27 ( 33.3 % ) had a history of previous cardiac events ( myocardial infarction , unstable angina and other cardiac problems ) , 40 ( 49.5 % ) had hypertension ( HTN ) , and 20 patients ( 24.7 % ) had a history of any kind of surgery in the past three months .
At the end of the study , 41 patients ( 50.61 % ) were diagnosed as definite PTE cases and 40 ( 49.39 % ) had a diagnosis other than PTE and were considered our control group .
From the Chi - square test , a significant difference was seen between gender percentages in the PTE and non - PTE groups , as 11 of the 41 ( 26.8 % ) PTE - positive patients were males , compared to 23 of 40 ( 56 % ) in the PTE - negative group ( p = 0.001 ) .
Other characteristics are shown in Table 1 .
Baseline Characteristics Of The Patients Included In The Study , Divided By Patients With And Without PTE
Mean C - reactive protein ( CRP ) level was 24.65 ± 16.64 mg / l and white blood cell count ( WBC ) was 11.11 ± 4.12 / mm .
As shown in Table 1 , none of the other parameters had significant differences between patients with and without PTE .
D - dimer , fibrinogen and DDFR
The mean values of D - dimer and fibrinogen levels were 3.99 ± 3.19 μ g / ml and 571.4 ± 196.1 mg / dl , respectively .
Mean DDFR was 0.712 ± 0.643 × 10 .
As shown in Table 2 , D - dimer and DDFR were significantly different between the PTE and non - PTE groups , but the fibrinogen level did not differ significantly .
Concentration Of D - Dimer , Fibrinogen And DDFR In Patients With And Without PTE ; Bold p - Values Are Significant
In order to find the best cut - off points for D - dimer , fibrinogen and DDFR as diagnostic tests for PTE , a ROC analysis was performed .
The ROC curve is used to calculate the area under the curve ( AUC ) as a measure of the diagnostic accuracy .
Based on this analysis , for DDFR ( AUC = 0.713 , p = 0.003 ) a value of 0.105 × 10 was 100 % sensitive and 1.621 × 10 was 100 % specific for a diagnosis of PTE .
Furthermore , this analysis on D - dimer values ( AUC = 0.721 , p = 0.002 ) showed a 100 % sensitivity for 0.43 μ g / ml and a 100 % specificity for 11.5 μ g / ml for the diagnosis of PTE .
The same analysis on fibrinogen did not show any significant cut - off point ( AUC = 0.410 , p = 0.198 ) ( Table 3 , Fig . 1 ) .
Results From Roc Analysis ; Bold Numbers Represent The Best Value Between All Cut - Off Points Calculated From The ROC Curve
Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to create a model to predict the risk for PTE using the significantly different independent variable studied at the level of p < 0.1 .
DDFR , gender , temperature and WBC were included in backward stepwise regression analysis .
The first model chosen was the best statistically ( p = 0.029 , R = 0.577 ) .
The results are shown in Table 4 .

Discussion
No significant difference was found in arterial blood gas and complete blood count analysis between the hospitalised PTE and non - PTE patients .
These results confirm other studies that showed arterial blood gas or its combination with other data could not be used to detect PTE , and if used alone , may lower the sensitivity and specificity [20,21] .
Fibrinogen ( factor I ) is a soluble plasma glycoprotein , synthesised by the liver and converted by thrombin into fibrin during blood coagulation [22] .
Fibrinogen may increase in acute and chronic conditions as an acute - phase reactant with the same signs and symptoms as PTE .
There are few studies on the relationship between fibrinogen level and PTE .
A study by Palla et al . showed that fibrinogen levels in PTE patients ( 498 ± 369 mg / dl ) were similar to those without PTE ( 520 ± 268 mg / dl ) ( p = 0.29.23 ) .
These results are similar to our results , which demonstrated no significant difference between fibrinogen levels in the PTE and non - PTE patients .
However , Kucher et al . showed that fibrinogen levels were significantly lower in patients with PTE ( p < 0.0001 ) [9] .
There is controversy about using fibrinogen levels as a reliable diagnostic test and it should not be used alone in order to diagnose PTE .
In addition , the fibrinogen level is unpredictable .
It can rise due to acute phases in the ICU or decrease in liver congestion due to right ventricular failure .
In recent years , several studies have been conducted to evaluate the accuracy of a diagnostic test to detect acute PTE in emergency settings .
Most demonstrated that D - dimer tests with cut - off points near 0.5 μ g / ml could be used as an exclusion test [9,23-25] .
As our study showed , D - dimer levels less than 0.43 μ g / ml had a 100 % sensitivity and a negative predictive value for ruling out PTE .
This confirms data from various studies demonstrating the ability of D - dimer to rule out PTE .
The only study that evaluated the D - dimer : fibrinogen ratio in PTE was conducted by Kucher et al [9] .
They found that a ratio above 1.04 × 10 had 100 % specificity and 57.6 % sensitivity for PTE and a two - fold diagnostic rate compared to D - dimer alone , with a cut - off point of 7 μ g / ml with 100 % specificity and 29.4 % sensitivity ( 57.6 % vs 29.4 % ) [9] .
A recent study however contradicted Kucher and co - workers ’ results .
Calvo - Romero ’ s study did not reveal a lower fibrinogen level in PTE patients with a positive D - dimer level , although it showed the D - dimer test to be less sensitive ( semi - quantitative latex agglutination D - dimer assay with 78 % sensitivity ) .
It also demonstrated that patients with PTE had fibrinogen levels within the normal range ( 200 - 400 mg / dl ) .
However , the sample size of the study was small compared to other studies in this field ( 40 cases ) [26] .
The aim of our study was to determine whether there was an inverse relationship between D - dimer and fibrinogen levels .
The theory was that while the activation of the coagulation cascade consumes fibrinogen in the pulmonary vasculature to form fibrin , the activation of fibrinolysis results in elevated fibrin degradation products such as D - dimer [9] .
This theory may be applicable in acute PTE without complications and for any other factor that may influence D - dimer and fibrinogen ( as an acute - phase reactant ) concentrations in out - patients .
In patients with other complications , these biomarkers will be different [11-15] .
We hypothesised that the conditions influencing D - dimer and fibrinogen levels would magnify the difference between these biomarkers when combined , and therefore lead to a more accurate diagnosis .
As our study shows , when using the same cut - off points that Kucher et al . presented , D - dimer > 7 μ g / ml was 24 % sensitive and 91.9 % specific , and DDFR > 10 was 35.1 % sensitive and 84.5 % specific .
Based on our study , D - dimer > 2.43 μ g / ml and DDFR > 0.233 × 10 had the best accuracy ( 70 and 67.1 % , respectively ) .
However neither was accurate enough to be used alone for the diagnosis of PTE in the ICU setting or in long - term hospitalised patients suspected of having PTE .
Study limitations
Up to the end of the first phase of our study , 91 patients were enrolled and after filtering by the exclusion criteria , 81 patients were included .
Due to the use of antithrombotic agents and good medical care , the incidence of PTE was low in the two hospitals where we collected the samples .
Therefore we could not divide the patients into groups with different setting , such as medical ICU and surgical ICU , in order to evaluate the influence of different settings on D - dimer level and DDFR .
We recommend a study to compare fibrinogen and D - dimer levels and DDFR in different settings and also in emergency departments as a unique study to make the comparison more reliable .
Conclusion
No significant difference was found in the biochemical assays between the hospitalised PTE and non - PTE patients .
Moreover , the significant difference in DDFR originated from D - dimer and not fibrinogen levels .
Therefore DDFR appears to be almost as useful as D - dimer in diagnosing PTE in the ICU setting .
In addition , it was possible to rule out PTE with only the D - dimer cut - off value of < 0.43 μ g / ml without using DDFR .
However , neither of these evaluations could replace angiography or CT angiography .
Background
Detection of COVID - 19 cases ’ accuracy is posing a conundrum for scientists , physicians , and policy - makers .
As of April 23 , 2020 , 2.7 million cases have been confirmed , over 190,000 people are dead , and about 750,000 people are reported recovered .
Yet , there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections .
Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false - negative tests .
Methods
We developed a deep learning model to improve accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X - ray scans .
Our model relied on convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns .
To do so , a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior - posterior radiographs of patients .
We used publicly available datasets to achieve this .
Results
Our results offer very high accuracy ( 96.3 % ) and loss ( 0.151 binary cross - entropy ) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide .
As the confusion matrix indicates , our model is able to accurately identify true negatives ( 74 ) and true positives ( 32 ) ; this deep learning model identified three cases of false - positive and one false - negative finding from the healthy patient scans .
Conclusions
Our COVID - 19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates identification of structural abnormalities in patient ’ s CXRs , and our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3 % accuracy .
Detection of COVID - 19 cases ’ accuracy is posing a conundrum for scientists , physicians , and policy - makers [ 1 , 2 ] .
As of April 23 , 2020 , 2.7 million cases have been confirmed , over 190,000 people are dead , and about 750,000 people are reported recovered [3] .
Yet , there is no publicly available data on tests that could be missing infections .
Complicating matters and furthering anxiety are specific instances of false - negative tests [4] .
Meanwhile , global tests per 1 million population by country vary : USA ( 11,067 ) , UK ( 6783 ) , Italy ( 21,598 ) , France ( 7103 ) , Spain ( 19,896 ) , and Canada ( 13,452 ) [3] .
The accuracy of reported COVID - 19 cases has never been more urgent especially given consideration of phased reopening of economies [ 5 , 6 ] .
Thus , to improve the accuracy of cases , we leverage a deep learning ( DL ) approach that helps minimize detection bias of COVID - 19 scans .
Deep learning ( DL ) is a special type of artificial neural network ( ANN ) inspired by the human cognition system .
In recent times , DL approaches have gained enormous research attention due to their excellent ability to learn underlying patterns and features from image databases and subsequently make predictions on new and unseen data .
Therefore , we predict the accuracy of COVID - 19 cases based on a novel artificial intelligence ( AI ) algorithm that uses a deep learning model to automatically and appropriately classify X - ray chest scans of COVID - 19 versus non - COVID - 19 images .
Methods
We developed a deep learning model to improve the accuracy of reported cases and to precisely predict the disease from chest X - ray scans .
Our model relied on convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) to detect structural abnormalities and disease categorization that were keys to uncovering hidden patterns .
To do so , a transfer learning approach was deployed to perform detections from the chest anterior - posterior radiographs of patients .
We used publicly available datasets to achieve this [ 7 , 8 ] .
Deep learning
One typical application of DL in radiology practice is detecting structural abnormalities and disease categorization .
In particular , convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) are proven to be very effective techniques in detecting abnormalities and pathologies in chest X - ray scans [8-10] .
Due to the recent outbreak of COVID - 19 worldwide , the demand for efficient and accurate automatic detection networks has risen sharply .
Chest X - ray radiography ( CXR ) is a commonly used imaging modality in the primary COVID - 19 screening process .
It is faster , simpler , cheaper , and less harmful than X - ray computed tomography ( CT ) .
However , detection of the COVID - 19 disease requires manual interaction from expert radiologists and at times the structural abnormalities from the patient CXRs are not visible to the human eye [11] .
Additionally , due to the growing number of patients and lack of clinical staff , accurate and automatic detection of the COVID - 19 disease from the patient CXRs may be of significant value .
Therefore , in this study , we developed a CNN - based model to perform COVID - 19 detections from chest radiographs ( Fig [1] . ) .
Network architecture
One major limitation of training CNNs for COVID - 19 detection is the lack of publicly available and expert labeled images .
Therefore , in this study , a transfer learning approach was deployed to design a CNN - based model to perform detections from the chest anterior - posterior radiographs of patients .
Previous studies in the literature have reported that transfer learning , despite using a different dataset , is an effective low - level feature detector and it has the potential to reduce the risk of overfitting [ 12 , 13 ] .
The proposed model was a modification of the VGG - 19 classifier previously trained on ImageNet , a very large dataset containing more than one million images [14] .
A trainable multilayer perceptron was added on top of the pre - trained VGG - 19 model to train and perform detections on our datasets ( Fig [1] . )
Datasets
We use publicly available frontal chest X - ray images from 181 patients [ 7 , 8 ] .
The dataset consisted of patient scans from Italy , Taiwan , China , Australia , Israel , among other locations and was labeled as positive COVID - 19 detection from expert radiologists .
The images were collected from a collection of recently published papers and articles as a global effort to encourage widespread and collaborative research in COVID - 19 detection [ 7 , 8 ] .
Images in this dataset contain additional information with regards to the patients ’ age , gender , survival , and location .
Moreover , the healthy chest X - ray scans used for training in this study were extracted from the public chest X - ray database provided by the NIH clinical center [8] .
We randomly selected 364 images from the pool of patient scans ( > 10,000 ) labeled as “ no finding ” to achieve an overall healthy - COVID - 19 ratio of approximately 1 : 2 .
Network training
To get results , first , we clone COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 X - ray scan data .
The parameters of this data include patient ’ s ID , sex , age , diagnosis ( COVID - 19 or not ) , survival ( yes or no ) , scan view ( e.g. , posteroanterior , supine anteroposterior ) , timestamp , and location .
Next , we initialize the variables for training by setting initial learning to 0.001 for the Adam optimizer , epochs to 100 , and batch size to 15 .
We split train , validation , and test data in the ratio of 80 : 20 : 20 ( number of healthy , COVID - 19 scans : train ( 233 , 115 ) , validation ( 56 , 32 ) , test ( 75 , 34 ) ) .
Prior to training , the patient scans were normalized to range ( 0 , 1 ) and resized to 512 × 512 pixel dimensions .
We trained the model on a Tesla K80 GPU ( Nvidia , Santa Clara , USA ) using early stopping and learning rate reduction on plateau .
Results
COVID - 19 patients ’ age ranged from 10 to 90 years ; offset , that is the number of days since the start of symptoms or hospitalization for each image , ranged from zero to 35 days ; just over 65 of the patients identified as male , and approximately 45 identified as female .
While we acknowledge the limited sample size , readers may want to appreciate the challenges and sensitivity associated with accessing X - ray scans of COVID - 19 patients .
Despite these limitations , our results offer very high accuracy ( 96.3 % ) and loss ( 0.151 binary cross - entropy ) using the public dataset consisting of patients from different countries worldwide ( Table [1] ) .
As the confusion matrix below ( Fig [2] . ) indicates , our model is able to accurately identify true negatives ( 74 ) and true positives ( 32 ) ; this deep learning model identified three cases of false - positive and one false - negative finding from the healthy patient scans .

Discussion
Our research examines a method to improve accuracy in COVID - 19 detection .
The authors deploy a transfer learning approach to design a CNN - based model to perform COVID - 19 detections from the chest anterior - posterior radiographs of patients .
We highlight two key findings : ( 1 ) our COVID - 19 detection model minimizes manual interaction dependent on radiologists as it automates the identification of structural abnormalities in patient ’ s CXRs and ( 2 ) our deep learning model is likely to detect true positives and true negatives and weed out false positive and false negatives with > 96.3 % accuracy .
In summary , our automated deep learning model reduces reliance on the human eye and offers a faster , simpler , and more accurate method for COVID - 19 detection .
Our analysis has unique strengths .
Our AI - based model brings forth the possibility of an automated COVID - 19 detection mechanism that might impact public policy and scientific research .
As we focus on detection bias at the level of individual cases and create an AI mechanism to weed out false positives and false negatives , we offer an automated alternative that reduces stress on public health infrastructure ( X - ray scans ) .
Our AI - based detection model can be rapidly deployed as it leverages small business infrastructure ( X - ray scans ) that maybe sitting idle due to the lockdown .
Our AI mechanism bridges public and private infrastructure ends as it helps idle clinics reposition themselves as tertiary testing centers as they pivot to testing rapidly by retooling X - ray scan facilities offering a lifeline to public hospitals .
The process may work as follows :
( 1 ) Patient visits these tertiary centres , reducing pressure on existing COVID - 19 testing centers and hospitals ; ( 2 ) scans are undertaken at tertiary centres ; ( 3 ) scans land in a safe digital repository ( e.g. , a local university ) ; ( 4 ) false positive and false negatives are weeded out by the AI deep learning model ; and ( 4 ) preliminary analysis is sent to a government COVID - 19 centre , who can recommend appropriate action .
Looking into the future , our AI - model extends support to large scale studies that aim to understand the presence of “ invisible cases , ” for instance , research focused on knowing how many people without obvious symptoms could be infected by the virus [15] .
Our automated approach can be a cheaper , faster , and simpler mechanism to support efforts to know the proportion of the population that may have already had the virus .
Scientists and health policy - makers can leverage the > 96.3 % accuracy of our deep learning model as they undertake large - scale randomized testing to investigate the extent to which the virus might have penetrated not just respective societies but also high - risk clusters within a given society .
An automated deep learning COVID - 19 detection approach will quicken our understanding of the underlying immunity developing across communities while we make decisions about public life in a pandemic .
Nevertheless , the authors acknowledge the limitations of this research .
First , our deep learning model relies on only 181 COVID - 19 cases ( and 115 used for training ) to arrive at a conclusion regarding the accuracy of our method .
It will help if we have access to more scans of COVID - 19 X - rays and incorporate scans with wider demographics .
Moreover , if we are looking to deploy this AI approach to make policy decisions about reopening economies , we may need access to behavioral characteristics ( e.g. , work , education , and leisure patterns ) to understand why some people may be invisible - they do not have symptoms but have the virus .
Additionally , this research has leaned upon recent literature that may still not be peer - reviewed .
However , the tradeoff under such difficult times is between extensive peer - reviews and rapid publishing of early indicators .
Finding a balance between the two may be more of an art than a science .
Despite these limitations , our goal is to add clarity to the scientific discussion around a crisis that most people did not see coming but now find themselves deeply enmeshed in .
As we contribute to the ongoing debate on detection bias and present an AI - based mechanism before the scientific community , we hope that policy - makers will take note of alternatives such as our deep learning model to find a path out of the lockdown .
DYNC2LI 1The short rib polydactyly syndromes ( SRPS ) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive , perinatal - lethal skeletal disorders characterized primarily by short , horizontal ribs , short limbs , and poly - dactyly .
Mutations in several genes affecting intraflagellar transport ( IFT ) cause SRPS but they do not account for all cases .
Here we identify additional SRPS genes and further unravel the functional basis for IFT .
We perform whole exome sequencing and identify mutations in a new disease - producing gene , cytoplasmic dynein - 2 light intermediate chain 1 , DYNC2LI 1 , segregating with disease in three families .
Using primary fibroblasts , we show that DYNC2LI 1 is essential for dynein - 2 complex stability and that mutations in DYNC2LI 1 result in variable - length , including hyperelongated , cilia , Hedgehog pathway impairment , and ciliary IFT accumulations .
The findings in this study expand our understanding of SRPS locus heterogeneity and demonstrate the importance of DYNC2LI 1 in dynein - 2 complex stability , cilium function , Hedgehog regulation , and skeletogenesis .
Introduction
The primary cilium is a microtubule - based projection on the surface of nearly every cell that acts as a concentrated signaling center for several pathways [1] .
Defects in the formation or function of primary cilia cause a wide variety of disorders known as ciliopathies .
As a testament to the importance of this organelle , ciliopathies collectively affect all major organ systems [2] , including the skeleton .
Cilium assembly and function require intraflagellar transport ( IFT ) , a system for bidirectional traffic into and out of this organelle .
IFT depends on the microtubule motor protein activities of two multi - protein complexes [3] : IFT - B , the kinesin - 2 - driven anterograde complex , mediates base - to - tip transport , and IFT - A , the dynein - 2 - driven retrograde complex , mediates tip - to - base transport .
The SRPS are autosomal recessive , perinatal - lethal disorders .
Radiographic abnormalities include very short , horizontal ribs , short limbs , and variable degrees of polydactyly .
Other organ system abnormalities , particularly those affecting the heart and kidney , are frequently seen .
SRPS are part of a spectrum of heterogeneous skeletal ciliopathies that include Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy ( ATD ) , Ellis van Creveld and Sensenbrenner syndromes .
Mutations in the gene encoding the IFT - A cytoplasmic dynein - 2 motor heavy chain , DYNC2H 1 ( MIM 603297 ) , are the most common cause of both SRPS and ATD [4,5] .
Recently , mutations in several additional genes have been shown to cause SRPS : IFT 80 [6,7] ( MIM 611263 ) , WDR 35 [8,9] ( MIM 614091 ) , WDR 19 [10] ( MIM 614376 ) , NEK 1 [11,12] ( MIM 263520 ) , WDR 34 [13,14] ( MIM 615633 ) , IFT 140 [15,16] ( MIM 266920 ) , IFT 172 [17] ( MIM 615630 ) , WDR 60 [18] ( MIM 615462 ) , and TTC 21B [19] ( MIM 612014 ) .
Among the proteins encoded by the SRPS genes , WDR 60 and WDR 34 are intermediate chains of the DYNC2H 1 cytoplasmic dynein - 2 complex , highlighting its importance in skeletal development [20] .
Here we show that mutations in another member of the complex , DYNC2LI 1 , also cause SRPS , in part through loss of complex stability .
The IFT - A dynein - 2 complex is composed of at least five components : the dynein heavy chain DYNC2H 1 ( DHC1b ) [21,22,23] , the two intermediate chains WDR 34 ( DIC 5 / FAP 133 ) [24] and WDR 60 ( FAP 153 ) [25] , the light intermediate chain DYNC2LI 1 ( D1bLIC / D2LIC / LIC 3 / XBX 1 ) [26,27,28,29] and the LC 8 light chain [30] .
DYNC2LI 1 was described as a novel dynein light intermediate chain based on its amino acid sequence , its ability to interact with DYNC2H 1 , and its localization to cilia [26,31] .
As an accessory chain binding to the base of the dynein - 2 complex , DYNC2LI 1 is likely involved in tethering the dynein - 2 motor to substrates such as vesicles and providing docking sites for cargo [26,31] .
It is essential for cilio - genesis and contains an X - box promoter that is recognized by the ciliary transcription factor RFX 3 / DAF - 19 [28,32] .
Recent studies have shown that DYNC2LI 1 is essential for dynein - 2 complex stability and its depletion in Trypansoma brucei and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii results in loss and mislocalization of DYNC2H 1 [24,29,33,34] .
Furthermore , DYNC2LI 1 mouse mutants result in lethality early in embryogenesis with developmental abnormalities characteristics of severe Hedgehog signaling defects [35] .
In this study , we identify mutations in DYNC2LI 1 causing SRPS in three independent cases .
We show that DYNC2LI 1 is essential for dynein - 2 complex stability , is expressed in the cartilage growth plate , and plays critical roles in the regulation of primary cilium length , retrograde IFT , and Hedgehog signaling .
Analysis of SRPS - derived fibroblasts supports a role for DYNC2LI 1 in cilia function and signaling and the findings highlight the importance of this gene and the dynein - 2 complex in skeletogenesis .
Results
DYNC2LI 1 mutations identified in SRPS cases
To identify additional genes that are essential for skeletal development , we used whole exome sequencing under an approved human subjects protocol and identified mutations in the dynein - 2 light intermediate chain gene , DYNC2LI 1 , producing SRPS .
Three probands from unrelated Caucasian families were identified by prenatal ultrasound and elective terminations were performed at 14 , 19 , and 22 weeks , respectively .
In the prenatal period , ultrasound findings included shortened long bones , diminished chest circumferences for gestational age , and polydactyly .
No other obvious organ system abnormalities were detected by ultrasound .
Radiographic analyses showed polydactyly of the upper and lower extremities , a long narrow thorax with very short horizontal ribs , lack of ossification of some skeletal elements , and irregular metaphyseal borders with lateral spikes ( Fig . 1 ) .
These findings are characteristic of SRPS and radiographically similar to SRPS cases described with DYNC2H 1 and WDR 34 mutations [4,13,36] .
In all three cases there was compound heterozygosity for mutations in DYNC2LI 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .
Two affected individuals , R 01 - 013A and R 03 - 303A , were heterozygous for changes in in - tron 12 ( c .993 + 1G > A , c .993 + 3A > G ) that are predicted to affect splicing ( Table 1 ) .
RT - PCR analysis on RNA derived from fibroblasts from both fetuses demonstrated that both mutations resulted in in - frame skipping of exon 12 ( Fig . 2a ) .
R 01 - 013A and R 07 - 628A were both heterozygous for a point mutation causing the predicted amino acid p.Leu 117Val substitution .
This missense mutation occurs within a region conserved among the three mammalian dynein light intermediate chains ( DLICs ) and resides within an NTPase - related domain ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) .
This mutation may interfere with cargo - binding as it occurs within a homologous region that is required for cargo - binding in DYNC1LI 1 [37] .
However , of the three mammalian DLICs , only DYNC2LI 1 interacts with the dynein - 2 complex ; the more closely related DYNC1LI 1 and DYNC1LI 2 are targeted to the non - ciliary cytoplasmic dynein - 1 , DYNC1H 1 [26,38] .
Finally , the other heterozygous changes in R 07 - 628A and R 03 - 303A were nonsense mutations in exon 6 ( p.Trp 124Ter ) and 13 ( p.Glu 334Ter ) , respectively .
Western blot analyses of fibroblast - derived lysates showed that DYNC2LI 1 is markedly reduced in R 01 - 013A ( c .993 + 1G > A ; p.Leu 117Val ) and R 07 - 628A ( p.Trp 124Ter ; p.Leu 117Val ) , indicating that these mutations likely lead to loss of DYNC2LI 1 stability ( Fig . 2b , c ) .
DYNC2LI 1 - mutant fibroblasts are depleted of DYNC2H 1
DYNC2H 1 and DYNC2LI 1 are distinct components of the ciliary dynein - 2 complex and studies in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Trypanosoma brucei show that loss of one results in loss or reduction of the other [24,29,33,34] .
To determine whether DYNC2H 1 amounts were affected by the decrease in DYNC2LI 1 , we probed whole - cell lysates from SRPS cases and controls for DYNC2H 1 and discovered near - total loss of protein ( Fig . 3a ) .
The amounts of the dynein - 2 intermediate chain WDR 34 and the heavy chain of the dynein - 1 complex ( DYNC1H 1 ) were unchanged , indicating that the effects of the DYNC2LI 1 mutations were specific to DYNC2H 1 .
Immunofluorescence staining showed that WDR 34 and the minimal remaining DYNC2H 1 in SRPS cells localized to the basal bodies , similar to controls ( Fig . 3b ) .
These results suggest that even though DYNC2LI 1 is important for the stabilization of DYNC2H 1 , it is not essential for the recruitment of the dynein - 2 complex to the pericentriolar region of basal bodies .
DYNC2LI 1 is expressed in the developing human growth plate
While the dynein - 2 complex is required for IFT in all ciliated cells of the body , the marked skeletal consequences of dynein - 2 complex mutations suggest that the developing skeleton is very sensitive to reductions in its activity .
Concordant with this hypothesis , transcriptional analysis by qRT - PCR showed that DYNC2LI 1 was more highly expressed in bone compared with other embryonic tissues ( bone , brain , cartilage , heart , liver , lung , placenta and thymus ) ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .
Furthermore , immunohistochemistry of human cartilage growth plate revealed DYNC2LI 1 expression in the perichondrium , periosteum and primary spongiosa of bone ( Fig . 4 ) .
Similarly , immunohistochemistry of DYNC2H 1 and WDR 34 showed an overlapping expression pattern ( Fig . 4 ) .
Together , these expression studies support a role for DYNC2LI 1 and the dynein - 2 complex in human skeletal development .
SRPS fibroblasts exhibit loss of ciliary length control
To investigate whether mutations in DYNC2LI 1 affect ciliogenesis and / or IFT , we quantified the fraction of ciliated cells , measured cilia length and probed SRPS and control fibroblasts for a number of ciliary components .
The percentage of ciliated cells was only slightly reduced between SRPS and control cells ( Fig . 5b ) .
However , we found that primary cilia length was highly variable in SRPS fibroblasts , with a substantial increase in the number of hyperelongated cilia up to 20 μ m in length ( Fig . 5a , c , d ) .
To determine if the ciliary length variation observed in SRPS cells resulted from decreased amounts of DYNC2LI 1 , we performed RNAi against DYNC2LI 1 in hTERT - RPE 1 ( retinal epithelial ) cells .
DYNC2LI 1 - knockdown led to significantly increased variation in cilia length , thus reproducing the phenotype observed in SRPS fibroblasts ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) .
To test for phenotypic rescue , we expressed wild type DYNC2LI 1 in SRPS cells .
As shown in Fig . 5c , d , transfection of DYNC2LI 1 into SRPS fibroblasts reduced ciliary length variation and restored length to control values .
We therefore conclude that DYNC2LI 1 and the dynein - 2 complex play an important role in the regulation of primary cilia length .
IFT components accumulate in DYCN2LI 1 - mutant cilia
The IFT - B components , IFT 88 and TRAF 3IP 1 , and the IFT - B kinesin motor , KIF3A , localized strongly to the base of the cilia and weakly along the axoneme in control cells , as observed by others [39] ( Fig . 6a ) .
Consistent with defective retrograde transport in SRPS fibroblasts , IFT 88 , TRAF 3IP 1 , and KIF3A all accumulated near the cilia tip .
More specifically , three to four fold more IFT 88 was retained in the axonemes of DYNC2LI 1 - mutant cilia than in controls ( Fig 6c ) .
RNAi - knockdown of DYNC2LI 1 in RPE 1 cells replicated this finding by increasing the ratio of IFT 88 retained in the primary cilium body relative to the proximal end by three fold ( Supplementary Fig . 4c , d ) .
In addition , we were able to reduce this ratio in SRPS fibroblasts by expressing wild type DYNC2LI 1 ( Fig . 6b , c ) .
Our results demonstrate that loss of DYNC2LI 1 markedly impairs retrograde IFT and leads to the accumulation of IFT proteins within the primary cilium .
SMO inappropriately enters the cilia of SRPS fibroblasts
Hedgehog signaling requires intact cilia and IFT ; not surprisingly , many IFT mutants display defects in this pathway [40] .
To determine if DYNC2LI 1 mutations affect Hedgehog signaling , we examined the localization of SMO and GLI 3 in SMO agonist ( SAG ) - stimulated and unstimulated fibroblasts from SRPS cases and controls .
While the localization of GLI 3 did not differ between SRPS and control cells ( Fig . 7a ) , we detected SMO along the length of cilia of unstimulated DYNC2LI 1 - mutant cells ( Fig . 7b , c ) .
In contrast , SMO was only observed in the cilia of control cells upon stimulation .
Similar to findings in DYNC2H 1 mouse mutants [41] , these observations suggest that DYNC2LI 1 and the activity of the dynein - 2 complex play an important role in preventing SMO from entering cilia in the absence of Hedgehog stimulation .
DYNC2LI 1 mutants exhibit reduced GLI 3 processing
To further investigate Hedgehog pathway activation , we measured GLI 3 processing in affected and control fibroblasts stimulated with SAG and quantified the ratio of GLI 3 full - length ( GLI3FL ) to re - pressor ( GLI3R ) forms by Western blot analysis .
We found that this ratio is increased two to three fold in DYNC2LI 1 - mutant fibroblasts as compared with control cells ( Fig . 7d , e ) .
An increased ratio of GLI3FL to GLI3R suggests impaired proteolytic processing of GLI 3 , which has been proposed to be the underlying cause for the polydactyly commonly seen in SRPS and other ciliopathies [42] .
In addition , total GLI 3 was markedly increased in unstimulated DYNC2LI 1 - mutant fibroblasts , implying that not only is processing altered but the total amount of available GLI 3 is abnormal as well ( Fig . 7d , f ) .
To test whether this altered ratio had functional consequences on transcription of Hedgehog targets , we performed quantitative RT - PCR of PTCH 1 and GLI 1 on control and SRPS fibroblasts .
We found that both control and SRPS cells responded to SAG with an increase in PTCH 1 and GLI 1 cDNA ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , suggesting that in these cells , the loss of the dynein - 2 complex stability does not completely impair their ability to respond to SAG .
Yet , altered GLI3FL to GLI3R ratios , together with the abnormal distribution of SMO into cilia of unstimulated SRPS cells , support impaired regulation of Hedgehog signaling in cells from SRPS cases with DYNC2LI 1 mutations .
Discussion
We show that DYNC2LI 1 mutations cause SRPS , expanding the number of genes associated with this condition .
The phenotypic findings in these SRPS cases are similar to those seen in cases with DYNC2H 1 [36] and WDR 34 [13] mutations , supporting that these proteins are part of the same complex .
Using SRPS fibroblasts we show that DYNC2LI 1 mutations result in loss of cilia length regulation , ciliary accumulation of IFT components , and aberrant Hedgehog pathway activity .
Rescue of mutant fibroblasts with human DYNC2LI 1 corrected the cilia phenotype , directly confirming that the changes in cilia length and IFT resulted from the loss of normal DYNC2LI 1 .
Our findings demonstrate that DYNC2LI 1 is involved in both the repression of Hedgehog activity in the absence of stimulation and the activation of Hedgehog in response to stimulation .
Alterations to Hedgehog signaling due to mutations in IFT - A proteins are typically mediated by either changes in cilia structure or trafficking , as opposed to non - ciliary functions of these proteins [43] .
In the absence of stimulation , SMO is actively excluded from the cilia and GLI 3 is processed into its repressor form .
We show that SMO inappropriately enters the cilium in the absence of SAG stimulation in SRPS but not in control cells ( Fig . 7b ) .
This abnormal ciliary localization of SMO has been seen in other IFT mutants as well , including DYNC2H 1 [41] and ICK [44] , and is suggestive of inappropriate Hedgehog pathway activation .
Whether this SMO is active or not remains to be determined , however the deficient processing of GLI 3 into the repressor form suggests the former in DYNC2LI 1 - mutant fibroblasts ( Fig . 7d , e ) .
We observed that DYNC2LI 1 - mutant SRPS cells exhibit increased amounts of GLI3FL with and without stimulation , increased ratios of GLI3FL to GLI3R , and decreased amounts of GLI3R upon stimulation as compared with controls .
However , we could not identify a grossly abnormal transcriptional response in SRPS cells .
This suggests that these cells can at least partially respond to Hedgehog signaling , though the in - vivo consequences of persistent altered GLI3FL to GLI3R amounts in certain tissues , particularly in a temporal manner , may underlie developmental abnormalities , particularly polydactyly , as seen in these SRPS cases .
We found that mutations in DYNC2LI 1 do not preclude cilia formation , but rather cause cilia length dysregulation .
Based on the phenotype of most mutants with diminished capacities for retrograde transport , including dynein - 2 complex mutants , it is interesting that cilia in DYNC2LI 1 mutants are longer than those in controls .
In Chlamydomonas , dynein - 2 null mutants ( dhc1b [21] ; stf - 1 , stf - 2 [22] ) have short , bulbous cilia with an accumulation of IFT - B components at their tips , suggesting an essential role for dynein - 2 in recycling ciliary components back to the cell body .
As IFT - B accumulates in these mutants , exhausting the pool of kinesin - 2 , the cilium loses its ability to grow or even maintain its length .
In contrast , the DYNC2LI 1 - mutant SRPS cases reported here have pronounced losses of both DYNC2H 1 and DYNC2LI 1 yet display robust ciliogenesis with longer - than - average cilia , despite having the characteristic IFT - B accumulations .
This is similar to dynein - 2 mutants in Tetrahymena ( KO - D2LIC ) [45] .
It is thus likely that the DYNC2LI 1 mutations alter the functioning of the dynein - 2 complex without abolishing function altogether .
The main defect in these cells appears to be loss of cilia length regulation as is evidenced by large variations in cilia lengths .
It is possible that the small amount of remaining normal DYNC2H 1 is enough to prevent the IFT congestion and stunted cilia seen in other mutants [46] .
We therefore conclude that the residual activity of the dynein - 2 complex in DYNC2LI 1 - mutant fibroblasts was enough to support robust ciliogenesis but insufficient to ensure the correct regulation of primary cilium size .
While we have shown that mutations in DYNC2LI 1 produce a severe skeletal dysplasia , little is known regarding the expression of this gene in distinct tissues .
Quantitative RT - PCR from RNA derived from a series of 16 - week fetal tissues showed that DYNC2LI 1 is expressed in all tissues studied , but is highest in bone ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .
Furthermore , the dynein - 2 complex proteins we evaluated localized to the perichondrium / periosteum and primary spongiosa of bone ( Fig . 4 ) , suggesting an important role in the developing skeleton .
These regions have been shown to be important for signaling and organization of a normal cartilage growth plate [47,48] .
The primary spongiosa , in particular , was reported to be irregular in SRPS cases with DYNC2H 1 mutations [4] with loss of degradation of the mineralized hypertrophic zone , supporting the potential role of the dynein - 2 complex in orchestrating the development of normal endochondral bone formation .
Localization of the dynein - 2 complex to the cartilage growth plate begins to provide insight into the reasons for altered endochondral ossification that are seen in SRPS .
In summary , our findings establish the clinical and cellular consequences of DYNC2LI 1 mutations and dynein - 2 complex disruption in human primary cells , and support the profound importance of this protein complex in proper skeletogenesis .

Average coverage of targeted bases was 103X , 61X , and 56X for R 01 - 013A , R 07 - 627A , and R 03 - 303A , respectively .
For each sample , at least 90 % of targeted bases were covered by at least 10 independent reads .
Variants were filtered against dbSNP 137 , 95 NIEHS EGP exome samples ( v. 0.0.8 ) , 6503 exomes from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project ( ESP 6500 ) , 1000 genomes ( release 3.20120430 ) , and 40 in - house exome samples .
Mutations were further compared with known disease - causing mutations in HGMD ( 2012.2 ) .
Variants were annotated using VAX [52] and mutation pathogenicity was predicted using the programs Polyphen [53] , Sift [54] , Condel [55] , and CADD [56] .
The mutations reported in this work were confirmed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing of amplified DNA from the proband and available parents ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .
Primer sequences used were :
DYNC2LI 1 - ex 6 F ’ : TTTTTGTTTTTGGGAGTCTTAGAA R ’ : TTGCTGTAATTTTCCAGTGAACA
DYNC2LI 1 - ex 12 F ’ : ACCTGGCAGAATTGGAAGTG R ’ : GGTGGGATGACAGGTGATTT
DYNC2LI 1 - ex 13 F ’ : GTGCTGCTTAGCCACACAGA R ’ : GTGGGCACTTAACCTTGCAT
Sequence trace files were aligned and analyzed using Geneious version 7.1.4 created by Biomatters ( http://www.geneious.com/ ) .
The samples were part of a larger cohort of SRPS samples submitted for the purpose of identifying novel disease genes and characterizing the incidence of mutations in known genes .
The cohort had not been previously tested for mutations in known SRPS - causing genes .
Filtering Strategy
We prioritized mutations predicted to affect protein function ( insertions or deletions , frameshifts , non - synonymous mutations , and essential spice site mutations ) .
We later included highly conserved splice region variants , allowing us to discover the DYNC2LI 1 + 3 splice site mutation .
We prioritized mutations that had not been previously seen in the homozygous state in control databases and mutations with a minor allele frequency < 0.005 .
Due to the recessive inheritance of SRPS , we looked for genes in which both alleles were potentially mutated .
DYNC2LI 1 stood out as a potential gene due to the incidence of unique , compound heterozygous mutations in three families in which the SRPS cases had strikingly similar X - ray features .
RT - PCR
RNA from SRPS case and control fibroblast cell lines was extracted using TRIZOL ( Invitrogen 15596 ) .
RT - PCR was performed using SuperScript III One Step Kit ( Invitrogen 12574 - 018 ) with the following DYNC2LI 1 primers targeting a 431 bp template spanning exon 12 : F ’ : CGCTGTTTATCACAGCAGGA R ’ : CCAAGAAATCCAGCTTGTCC .
An amplified fragment of 431 bp corresponds to the wild - type RNA and a fragment of 339 bp corresponds to a transcript missing exon 12 .
Quantitative RT - PCR
Total RNA was extracted from a series of 16 - week fetal tissues as well as from control , R 01 - 013A and R 07 - 628A fibroblasts ( with and without SAG treatment ) using TRIZOL ( Invitrogen 15596 ) .
cDNA was treated with DNAase ( Invitrogen 18068 ) and reversed transcribed ( Thermo Scientific K1621 ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions .
Quantitative RT - PCR was performed with a real - time PCR detection system ( Stratagene MX 3005P ) using SYBR green PCR master mix ( Thermo Scientific K0222 ) and standard thermocycler conditions .
qRT - PCRs were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 25 μ l for 3 independent replicates .
Each sample was analyzed for two housekeeping genes to normalize for RNA input amounts and to perform relative quantifications .
Levels of transcripts in controls were set at 1 .
Melting curve analysis showed a single , sharp peak with the expected melting temperature for all samples .
RT - PCR primers sequences were as follows :
Molecular cloning of DYNC2LI 1
Human DYNC2LI 1 cDNA ( NM _ 016008.3 ) was synthesized using gBlock from IDT .
The cDNA was flanked by XhoI and NotI restriction sites , which were used for insertion into pCAGIG , a pCAG - IRES - GFP vector ( a gift from Connie Cepko ( Addgene plasmid # 11159 ) ) .
The final construct was then used to express both untagged DYNC2LI 1 and GFP in SRPS fibroblasts for the rescue experiments .
Cell culture
Unless otherwise stated , control and SRPS human fibroblasts from patients were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 % Penicillin / Streptomycin / L - Glutamine and were maintained at 37 ° C with 5 % CO .
For serum starvation and to promote ciliogenesis , cells were washed in PBS and incubated with serum - free media ( or supplemented with 0.5 % FBS ) for 48 hrs .
For stimulation of the sonic hedgehog pathway , serum - free media was supplemented with 500 nM SAG ( Calbiochem 566660 ) for 24 - 48 hrs before cell fixation .
hTERT - RPE 1 - GFP - CSAP cells ( a kind gift from I . Cheeseman ) [57] were grown in DMEM / F12 supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 % Penicillin / Streptomycin and were maintained at 37 ° C with 5 % CO .
Rescue experiments
Transfections of SRPS fibroblasts with hDYNC2LI 1 IRES GFP were performed using Amaxa Kit for Primary Mammalian Fibroblasts according to manufacturer ’ s instructions and program T - 16 .
24 hrs following transfection , cells were washed in PBS and incubated with serum - free media for an additional 48 hrs .
RNAi
For RNA - mediated interference , siGENOME ( 51626 ) Human DYNC2LI 1 siRNA smartpool ( Dharma - con ) was employed against the following target sequences :
5 ’ - GGAAUAAUAUGCCGAAGGA - 3 ’
5 ’ - CAAAAGAUAUCGCUCACUU - 3 ’
5 ’ - CCAUGUAGACAAAGUGAUA - 3 ’
5 ’ - GGAAAGACUACUAUUAUUC - 3 ’ .
Non - targeting siRNA was used as a control .
RNAi was carried out using the Hiperfect reagent ( Qiagen ) , according to manufacturer ’ s instructions .
48 hrs following RNAi transfection , hTERT - RPE 1 - GFP - CSAP cells [57] ( RPE 1 cells with ciliary axoneme and centrioles marked by CSAP ) were washed in PBS and incubated with an additional round of RNAi in serum - free media for 48 hrs to induce ciliogenesis .
Knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting .
Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded into 4 - well chamber slides ( LabTek ) at a density of 4 x 10 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight .
After serum starvation , cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 95 % methanol with 5 mM EGTA ( pre - chilled to - 20 ° C ) for 5 min .
Alternatively , cells were fixed in 4 % PFA for 15 min at room temperature , washed , and then permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton - X - 100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature .
After extensive washing , cells were blocked in PBS containing 5 % serum for 1 hr at room temperature .
Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1 - 5 % serum .
Cells were incubated with the following primary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 ° C : rabbit anti - WDR 34 ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam ab 81030 ) , rabbit anti - DYNC2H 1 [26] ( 1 : 150 ; Dynein HC 2 ) , rabbit anti - ARL 13B ( 1 : 150 ; Proteintech 17711 - 1 - AP ) , rabbit anti - IFT 88 ( 1 : 150 ; Proteintech 13967 - 1 - AP ) , rabbit anti - KIF3A ( 1 : 150 ; Sigma - Aldrich K3513 ) , rabbit anti - TRAF 3IP 1 ( 1 : 100 ; Pierce PA 5 - 30507 ) , mouse anti - acetylated β - tubulin ( 1 : 2,000 ; 6 - 11B - 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich T6793 ) , rabbit anti - acetylated β - tubulin ( 1 : 800 ; D20G 3 ; Cell Signaling Technology # 5335 ) , mouse anti - polyglutamylated tubulin ( GluTUB ) ( 1 : 300 ; Adipogen GT 335 ) , SMO ( 1 : 300 ; a kind gift from K . Anderson ) , and goat anti - GLI 3 ( 10 μ g mL ; R&D Systems AF 3690 ) .
After extensive washing , cells were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488 / 568 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 400 ; Invitrogen and Jackson ImmunoResearch ) in PBS containing 5 % serum .
For rescue experiments in Figs . 5d and 6b , Cy 5 - and Cy 3 - labeled secondary antibodies ( 1 : 400 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch ) were used to detect ARL 13B / IFT 88 and GluTUB , respectively .
Images were captured on an IX 80 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Olympus FV 100 Spectral Confocal System ) or a Leica Confocal TCS - SP 2 using a 100x 1.40 N.A . or a 63X ( oil ) objective 1.2 N.A .
Images were collected with 1024x 1024 pixel definition and Z - sections were taken at 0.5 μ m step size .
Max projections of the Z - stacks were used for primary cilium measurement and counting in ImageJ ( NIH ) .
To assess the impact of DYNC2LI 1 mutations on ciliogenesis , we examined the localization of the ciliary membrane and axoneme markers ARL 13B and glutamylated tubulin .
ARL 13B is a membrane protein belonging to the Arf family of GTPases that constitutively localizes to cilia .
ARL 13B signal is dispersed in the cytoplasm if a cell does not have a cilium , which allowed us to confidently score the percentage of ciliated cells when co - staining with an axonemal marker .
Tubulin acetylation and glu - tamylation [58] are post - translational modifications associated with stable microtubule structures such as the cilia axoneme and , for glutamylated tubulin , the basal body and other centrioles .
Quantification of IFT 88 retention in the distal end of primary cilia was performed in similar - sized primary cilia using ImageJ ( NIH ) .
Polyglutamylated tubulin staining of centrioles and the proximal end of the axoneme served to determine the orientation of each primary cilium , allowing for the measurement of IFT 88 signal intensity in the proximal end and in the remaining body of each primary cilium .
After determining the ratio of IFT 88 signal in each primary cilium , the resulting values were used to determine the average ratio of IFT 88 signal for each experiment .
Statistical analyses were performed with Prism v 5.0 ( GraphPad ) .
Immunohistochemistry
A human humerus from a 14 - week fetus was fixed in PFA and decalcified with Immunocal for 2 days .
After decalcification , samples were embedded in paraffin and 10 μ m sections were prepared .
Sections were treated with citrate buffer for antigen retrieval and quenched by peroxidase solution for 10 min each .
Primary antibodies used were : rabbit anti - DYNC2LI 1 [26] ( 1 : 200 ; LIC 3 ) , rabbit anti - WDR 34 ( 1 : 150 ; Sigma HPA 041091 ) and rabbit anti - DYNC2H 1 [26] ( 1 : 150 ; Dynein HC 2 ) .
After primary incubation , a Histostain Plus kit ( Invitrogen 85 - 9243 ) was used for development with DAB .
Protein / Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in 1X RIPA Buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) .
Lysates were cleared by centrifugation ( 10 min at 16,000 x g at 4oC ) .
20 - 80 μ g of protein per sample was loaded onto 10 % or gradient SDS - polyacrylamide gels and separated by electrophoresis .
Proteins were transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes , which were then blocked with 5 % milk for 1 hr at room temperature .
Membranes were then probed with primary antibodies diluted in 1 - 5 % milk or BSA for 3 hrs at room temperature or overnight at 4 ° C : rabbit anti - DYNC2LI 1 [26] ( 1 : 200 ; LIC 3 ) , rabbit anti - WDR 34 ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam ab 81030 ) , rabbit anti - DYNC2H 1 [26] ( 1 : 150 ; Dynein HC 2 ) , rabbit anti - GAPDH ( 1 : 1,000 ; 14C 10 ; Cell Signaling Technology # 2118 ) , mouse anti - β - tubulin ( 1 : 10,000 ; GTU - 88 ; Abcam ab 11316 ) , mouse anti - β - tubulin ( 1 : 5000 ; Sigma T9026 ) , and goat anti - GLI 3 ( 1 μ g mL ; R&D Systems AF 3690 ) .
After extensive washing , membranes were incubated with HRP - conjugated or fluorescent secondary antibodies and the signal was captured on film or in an Odyssey system ( Licor ) .
Protein amounts were quantified from scanned blots using ImageJ ( NIH ) .
Full scans of Western blot data are included in Supplementary Fig . 6 .

SESSION TITLE : Cardiothoracic Surgery Posters
SESSION TYPE : Original Investigation Posters
PRESENTED ON : October 18 - 21 , 2020
PURPOSE : Robotic lobectomy has been associated with a median length of stay of 4 days .
We hypothesized that with a standard Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) protocol , robotic lobectomies could be discharged as early as post - operative day 1 .
METHODS : Between March 2017 and March 2020 , a total of 239 robotic - assisted lobectomies were performed by a single surgeon .
All operations included additional procedures , such as mediastinal and hilar lymph node dissections , bronchoscopies , en bloc resections , intercostal nerve blocks and lysis of adhesions .
RESULTS : 20 patients were discharged home on post - operative day 1 .
Of these , 13 were female and 7 were male .
The average age was 65 years .
8 patients had cardiovascular disease , 2 had chronic kidney disease and 7 had a history of other cancer .
The average body mass index was 28.9 kg / m2 .
The average pack years smoked was 24.3 .
The average FEV 1 was 2.3L which was 87 % predicted ( median 2.0L , 91 % predicted ) .
The average diffusion capacity was 82 % predicted ( median 79 % predicted ) .
6 patients underwent left lower lobectomy , 5 left upper lobectomy , 4 right upper lobectomy , 3 right middle lobectomy and 2 right lower lobectomy .
The most common pathology was adenocarcinoma ( 7 patients ) followed by squamous cell carcinoma ( 5 patients ) , and other pathologies in 8 patients .
There were 3 post - discharge complications within 30 days requiring intervention ; thoracentesis ( 1 patient ) , atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response ( 1 patient ) , and acute kidney injury in a patient with chronic kidney disease ( 1 patient ) .
There were no readmissions for pleural effusion or pneumothorax .
There were no mortalities .
CONCLUSIONS : An underemphasized , but very important , additional benefit of robotic lobectomy is shortened length of stay .
Our study demonstrates that post - operative day 1 discharge after lobectomy is possible , and is associated with low risk for complication and readmission .
Additionally , the application of an ERAS - based care path improves patient outcomes and strengthens team - based collaboration by streamlining post - operative care practices and expectations .
This decreased length of hospitalization reduces risks for nosocomial infections ( including COVID - 19 ) and improves resource utilization .
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS : Early discharge was the goal of our ERAS protocol applied to all lobectomy patients .
Important features include : - Pre - operative education and counseling ( including the possibility of day 1 discharge ) - Multimodal pain relief regimen - Early out of bed mobilization and ambulation - Atrial fibrillation prophylaxis ( usually low dose beta blocker ) - Repletion of potassium and magnesium - Water seal of chest tubes post - operative day 1 - Early and frequent air leak checks with forced cough and Valsalva maneuver - Chest tube removal when air leak resolved - Discharge same day of tube removal if subsequent chest x - ray without pneumothorax

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with unclear pathogenesis .
Many clinical observations and hormone studies have suggested the involvement of the neuroprotective hormone ghrelin in autism .
The current study aimed to investigate the potential role of ghrelin in autism and to elucidate the associated hormonal dysregulation .
This case - control study investigated acyl ghrelin ( AG ) , des - acyl ghrelin ( DG ) , total testosterone ( TT ) , free testosterone ( FT ) , leptin and growth hormone ( GH ) levels in 31 male children with autism and 28 healthy age and sex - matched controls .
Hormone levels were measured in the blood using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence immunoassay kits .
AG , DG and GH levels were significantly lower in the autism group than in the control group ( p ≤ 0.001 , p ≤ 0.005 and p ≤ 0.05 , respectively ) .
However , TT , FT and leptin levels were significantly higher in the autism group than in the control group ( p ≤ 0.05 , p ≤ 0.001 and p ≤ 0.01 , respectively ) .
Our results for the first time demonstrate low AG and DG levels in autistic children .
Considering the capacity of ghrelin to affect neuroinflammatory and apoptotic processes that are linked to autism , this study suggests a potential role for the hormone ghrelin in the pathogenesis of autism .
Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are a group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that are classified as pervasive developmental disorders .
ASDs are usually characterised by clinical manifestations of delayed or abnormal language development , deficits in social interaction , repetitive behaviours and restricted interest [1] .
The pathogenesis of autism is not completely understood ; however , a genetic origin has been recognised , and potential roles for both environmental factors and immune dysfunction have also been reported [1] .
Hormonal dysregulation in autism remains a strong candidate , as a wide range of hormonal abnormalities have been identified in autistic children .
This finding indicates the significant involvement of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis in the pathophysiology of the disease [1] .
A significant volume of scientific evidence suggests a possible role for the hormone ghrelin in autism .
Ghrelin is a 28 - amino acid peptide that stimulates growth hormone ( GH ) release from the anterior pituitary gland [2] .
Ghrelin has a wide range of physiological functions , and it represents a molecular link between peripheral metabolism and brain cognition .
The hippocampus , which is the main target of action for ghrelin in the central nervous system ( CNS ) and plays an important role in memory and learning [3] , is also affected in autism [4] .
Moreover , ghrelin plays an important role in synaptogenesis , mainly in the hippocampal area [5] , and abnormal synaptogenesis in this area has been reported in autism [6] .
Ghrelin has proliferative and anti - apoptotic effects in the CNS , especially during oxygen / glucose deprivation ; thus , it may protect the hypothalamus against reactive oxygen species , which have recently been linked to autism [7] .
In addition , ghrelin protects primary cortical neurons from apoptosis induced by glutamate , an amino acid that is elevated in autistic children [8] .
Ghrelin influences the sleep - wake cycle , and its levels increase in the first hours of sleep in healthy individuals [9] .
Additionally , ghrelin is the most powerful orexigenic peptide and is known to suppress locomotor activity [10] .
Sleep and appetite disturbances , and hyperactivity are among the frequent problems facing children with autism [11] .
These observations , taken together , prompted us to hypothesise that ghrelin could be involved in the pathogenesis of autism .
It wasn ' t clearly distinctive in the literature which of those actions mediated through AG and which were mediated through DG despite AG is considered generally the active form [17] .
Ghrelin cannot function in isolation from other hormones ; for example , in many clinical settings , ghrelin plasma levels are negatively correlated with elevated plasma testosterone levels [12] , and pre - pubertal testosterone therapy has been shown to be associated with a significant decrease in circulating ghrelin levels in boys [13] .
At the same time , androgens are implicated in the pathophysiology of autism , as hyper - androgenism has been reported in children with autism [11] .
This relationship suggests that ghrelin is prone to suppression by the elevated androgens in children with autism .
Similarly , the hormone leptin represents another potential link between ghrelin and autism , as these hormones have an inverse relationship [14,15] .
Leptin inhibits ghrelin transcription in a dose - dependent manner , thus reducing ghrelin levels [16] , and leptin levels have been reported to be significantly higher in children with autism [14] .
These elevated leptin levels may be associated with decreased ghrelin levels in autism .
However , ghrelin and GH are strongly connected , as ghrelin is known for its capacity to stimulate the release of GH [17] .
Additionally , in an animal model of induced GH deficiency , gastric ghrelin mRNA levels and circulating ghrelin levels were significantly reduced , suggesting that ghrelin gene expression is influenced by GH status [18] .
In light of the above - mentioned findings , this study was conducted to elucidate the possible role of ghrelin in autism , which was accomplished by measuring plasma ghrelin levels in autistic boys and healthy age - matched controls .
This study also aimed to further elucidate the associated hormonal dysregulation ; thus , serum levels of androgens , leptin and GH were also measure .
Methods
Subject selection
This case - control study was conducted on 59 male children : 31 had classic - onset autism , and 28 were age - and sex - matched healthy control children .
Their ages ranged from 3 to 8 years ( mean ± SD = 5.59 ± 2.26 years ) .
All of the boys included in the study were pre - pubertal ( Tanner stage 1 ) .
Boys with autism were recruited from the Autism Research and Treatment Center , College of Medicine , King Saud University , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
The study was limited to the male sex because of the lack of female patients .
The patients in this study fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of autism according to the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and statistical Manual of Mental disorders ( DSM 4 ) ( American Psychiatric association : Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 4th ed . Washington DC : American Psychiatric Association , 1994 . ) .
ADOS ( Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ) and CARS ( Childhood Autism Rating Scale ) was performed to assign the diagnosis of autism according to DSM 4 .
The patients included in this study had no associated neurological diseases ( such as cerebral palsy or tuberous sclerosis ) or metabolic disorders ( e.g. , phenylketonuria ) .
None of the patients have intellectual disability .
Written consent was obtained from the parents according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) of the College of Medicine , King Saud University , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia .
The IRB approved the study protocol ( approval no . E - 10 - 341 ) .
Anthropometric measurements
The height and weight of individuals in the autism and control groups were measured using an electronic scale .
The occipito - frontal head circumference , waist circumference and hip circumference were measured using a meter .
The body mass index ( BMI ) and waist to hip ratio ( W / H ) were calculated .
Biochemical assays
Venous blood samples ( 7 mL ) were collected between 8 : 00 and 9 : 00 am after an overnight fast and were divided immediately as follows : a 3 mL aliquot of blood was dispensed into an EDTA tube containing 30 μ L of p - hydroxymercuribenzoic acid ( PHMBA ) to prevent the degradation of acyl ghrelin ( AG ) .
This sample was used to measure both AG and DG .
A 4 mL aliquot of blood was dispensed into a plain plastic tube and was used to measure total testosterone ( TT ) , free testosterone ( FT ) , sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) , leptin and baseline GH .
The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3 500 r.p .m . followed by the addition of 100 μ L of 1 N HCl to the EDTA tube samples , which were further centrifuged for 5 min at 3 500 r.p .m .
The blood samples were immediately separated and stored at − 80 ° C until use in the assay , and they were not subjected to freeze / thaw cycles .
Plasma levels of AG and DG were measured using SPI - BIO enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kits obtained from IBL International GMBH .
Baseline serum levels of GH were measured using LIAISON ™ hGH chemiluminescence immunoassay kits obtained from Diasorin , USA .
Serum leptin , TT , FT and SHBG levels were measured using DIAsource ELISA kits ( Nivelles , Belgium ) .
All sample measurements were performed in duplicate ; thus , two kits per hormone were used .
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed using SPSS Pc + statistical software ( version 18.0 ) .
Normality was tested , and the normal distribution of the data was confirmed .
The independent samples t test was used to compare means between the autism and control groups .
The correlation between different variables was determined using the Karl Pearson correlation coefficient .
Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05 .
Results
Data for the anthropometric measurements and hormonal analysis are presented in Table 1 , Table 2 and Table 3 as the mean values ± standard deviation .
As Table 1 shows , the only significant difference between the autistic group and the controls occurred in body weight , which was 18 % higher in the autistic group than in the controls ( 22.7 ± 7.9 vs . 19.3 ± 4.1 kg ; p ≤ 0.05 ) .
The mean of body mass Index for children with autism falls between the 50 and 75 percentile which doesn ' t indicate obesity .
As Table 2 shows , AG levels were lower in the autistic group than in the controls ( 116.7 ± 50.3 vs . 170.5 ± 59.3 pg / mL ; p ≤ 0.001 ) .
Similarly , DG levels were also lower in autistic individuals compared to the controls ( 214.4 ± 80.5 vs . 299.3 ± 139.7 pg / mL ; p ≤ 0.005 ) .
In the autistic group , TT levels were higher than those in the controls ( 20.1 ± 17.4 vs . 13.1 ± 6.7 ng / dL ; p ≤ 0.05 ) .
Moreover , FT levels were higher in the autistic group than in the controls ( 90.8 ± 77.9 vs . 26.8 ± 22.9 pg / dL ; p ≤ 0.001 ) .
However , there was no significant difference in SHBG levels between the autistic group and the controls ( 106 ± 42.4 vs . 101.8 ± 30.1 nmol / L ; p = 0.6 ) .
Leptin concentrations were higher in the autistic group compared to the control group ( 1.4 ± 1.3 vs . 0.67 ± 0.5 ng / mL ; p ≤ 0.01 ) .
In autistic children , GH levels were lower compared to the levels in the controls ( 0.53 ± 0.5 vs . 1 ± 1.2 ng / mL ; p ≤ 0.05 ) .
Table 3 shows the hormone levels in a weight - matched group to exclude the effect of adiposity on ghrelin and leptin levels .
Correlation analysis
Correlation analyses between the measured hormones and different variables in the autism group were performed as follows :
Correlations of AG with different variables : AG had significant negative correlations with age ( r = − 0.48 , p ≤ 0.007 ) , weight ( r = − 0.35 , p ≤ 0.05 ) , BMI ( r = − 0.39 , p ≤ 0.05 ) , waist circumference ( r = − 0.50 , p ≤ 0.01 ) , hip circumference ( r = − 0.36 , p ≤ 0.05 ) and W / H ratio ( r = − 0.41 , p ≤ 0.05 ) .
However , AG had a significant positive correlation with DG ( r = + 0.59 , p ≤ 0.001 ) .
No correlation between AG and other hormones were found .
Correlations of DG with different variables : DG had significant negative correlations with age ( r = − 0.51 , p ≤ 0.01 ) , FT ( r = − 0.43 , p ≤ 0.05 ) ( Figure 1 ) and head circumference ( r = − 0.36 , p ≤ 0.05 ) .
Correlations of TT and FT with different variables : TT had significant positive correlations with FT ( r = + 0.7 , p ≤ 0.001 ) , age ( r = + 0.44 , p ≤ 0.05 ) , waist circumference ( r = + 0.37 , p ≤ 0.05 ) and hip circumference ( r = + 0.37 , p ≤ 0.05 ) .
FT had significant positive correlations with height ( r = + 0.49 , p ≤ 0.01 ) , weight ( r = + 0.54 , p ≤ 0.01 ) , BMI ( r = + 0.40 , p ≤ 0.05 ) , waist circumference ( r = + 0.59 , p ≤ 0.001 ) , hip circumference ( r = + 0.52 , p ≤ 0.01 ) and leptin level ( r = + 0.42 , p ≤ 0.01 ) .
Correlations of leptin with different variables : Leptin level had significant positive correlations with height ( r = + 0.53 , p ≤ 0.01 ) , weight ( r = + 0.67 , p ≤ 0.001 ) , BMI ( r = + 0.56 , p ≤ 0.001 ) , waist circumference ( r = + 0.61 , p ≤ 0.001 ) , hip circumference ( r = + 0.72 , p ≤ 0.001 ) and head circumference ( r = + 0.43 , p ≤ 0.02 ) .
Discussion
Numerous hormone studies have been undertaken in children with autism ; however , to our knowledge , this study is the first in which ghrelin was measured .
Plasma levels of both AG and DG were significantly reduced in the autism group compared with healthy controls .
This result can be attributed to local factors affecting ghrelin - secreting cells and to hormonal influences .
Gastrointestinal ( GIT ) problems are frequent in autism , including dysbiosis , chronic GIT inflammation and chronic fungal , viral and bacterial infections [19] .
These disorders could affect the gastric mucosa and interfere with the normal function of ghrelin - secreting cells .
Furthermore , ghrelin deficiency by itself can affect the gastric mucosa , as ghrelin is known for its role in maintaining mucosal health and integrity [20] .
Thus , a loss of mucosal health and integrity could result in a further decrease in plasma ghrelin levels .
Alterations in plasma ghrelin levels may also be part of the extensive , well - studied hormonal dysregulation that characterizes autism , particularly the dysregulation of TT , FT , leptin and GH .
In agreement with the findings of the current study , previous studies have shown that androgen levels are significantly higher in autism patients [11] .
At the same time , it is well established that ghrelin plasma levels are negatively correlated with high plasma testosterone levels [12] .
The current study confirms the negative correlation between FT and DG .
This correlation may indicate that the reduced plasma level of ghrelin in autistic children is in part a consequence of suppression by elevated androgens .
Another hormone that has been studied in autism is leptin .
Its relevance to ghrelin function comes from the observation that elevated plasma leptin levels are associated with reduced plasma ghrelin levels [14,15] .
This finding is in agreement with the results of the current study , which revealed a significant elevation of leptin and a reduction of ghrelin levels in the autism group .
In support of this notion , Komori et al . provided a novel molecular link between leptin and ghrelin signaling , namely , the leptin - induced negative regulatory element - binding protein ( NREBP ) , which suppresses ghrelin signalling [21] .
The high serum leptin levels in the current study is consistent with other studies that reported a significant elevation of leptin levels in autistic children [14,22] .
The elevation of leptin levels can be explained in part by the observed significant elevation of androgen levels in autistic children .
Both animal and human studies have shown that adipocytes have androgen receptors ( ARs ) , and androgens are known to modulate the plasma leptin level [23,24] .
Consistent with these reports , the current study revealed a significant positive correlation between leptin and FT .
The significant elevation of leptin levels in autism may also be a consequence of the significant decrease in GH levels in autistic children , as will be discussed later .
Alterations in the levels of both ghrelin and leptin are known to be associated with adiposity [25,26] .
As can be noted from the anthropometric data in the current study , the only significant difference between the autism and control groups was in body weight , which was significantly higher in the autism group .
To exclude the effect of weight on the levels of these hormones , we excluded four children with high body weight from the autism group to create a group that was age - , sex - and weight - matched with the controls , as shown in Table 3 .
As presented in Table 3 , there were significant reductions in both AG and DG plasma levels , with a significant increase in the plasma leptin level in the autism group compared with weight - matched controls .
It is intriguing the fact that children with autism have increased weight despite low ghrelin ( an orexigenic hormone ) and high leptin ( an anorexigenic hormone ) levels ; this could be suggesting a drastic impairment in the central processing of such peripheral signals .
Another possible explanation is the complexity through the involvement of many hormones other than ghrelin and leptin which might play role in affecting body weight .
In the present study , the significantly lower levels of both ghrelin and GH in autism are consistent with the unique relationship between these two hormones [17] .
A genetic connection may also be present , as GH levels can affect ghrelin gene expression [18] and , thus , can influence ghrelin plasma levels .
The present study revealed a significant negative correlation between DG and head circumference , which is similar to what was reported in children with Rett ' s syndrome [27] .
This correlation implies that ghrelin may be involved in neurogenesis or neuroprotective effects in autism , as accelerated head circumference growth in the first year of life is considered as an early warning sign of autism in children [28] .
Ghrelin is also known to play an important role in immune modulation in the CNS ; in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , ghrelin inhibits the production of the pro - inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - α ) , interleukin - 1 ( IL - 1 ) and IL - 6 , with microglia being the main target cells .
Microglia are the main immunocompetent cells in the immature CNS and , in turn , can acquire various phenotypes that determine the CNS consequences of inflammation .
It has been suggested that autism is a result of CNS derangements due to chronic inflammatory reactions [29] .
This critical anti - inflammatory property of ghrelin indicates that it may serve as an anti - inflammatory agent for the control of human CNS disturbances triggered by the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
Thus , the findings of the present study , which revealed significantly lower plasma ghrelin levels in autistic children , strongly suggest a potential role for ghrelin in the pathophysiology of autism .
However , the neuronal influence of leptin cannot be excluded , as leptin influences neurons by altering their structure and plasticity [30] .
Furthermore , a role for leptin in brain development and maturation is suggested based on the capacity of leptin to regulate brain weight , brain protein content and several neuronal and glial markers [31] .
The present study revealed a significant positive correlation between leptin and head circumference in the autism group , which could indicate a potential role for leptin in the pathogenesis of autism , as accelerated growth of head circumference in the first year of life is a known feature of autism [22] .
Additionally , leptin replacement in leptin - deficient humans leads to gross changes in brain structure , including an increase in grey matter volume in several discrete areas of the brain and an increase in brain weight [30] .
These results indicate that leptin has a direct effect on brain size and subsequently on head circumference [30] .
The relationship between leptin and GH is also illustrated by the finding that serum leptin levels were altered depending on GH status , predominantly as a result of changes in fat mass and distribution [32] .
Leptin levels were reduced after GH replacement therapy , and this effect was thought to be secondary to reduction in fat mass [32] .
In contrast , another study found that leptin levels were significantly increased after a single dose of GH and subsequently dropped below the baseline ; this observation indicates that GH has a direct regulatory effect on leptin gene expression [33] .
Furthermore , changes in leptin concentrations at 1 and 3 months after the beginning of GH replacement therapy in GH - deficient individuals were correlated with growth in the first year of treatment [34] .
The high leptin levels and the low GH levels observed in the current study confirm these earlier observations .
The present study revealed significant lower GH levels in autistic children compared with controls .
Although autistic children exhibited no physical features of GH deficiency , particularly with respect to anthropometric parameters , these findings do not rule out the involvement of GH deficiency for the following reasons : first , the role of GH is not limited to physical growth ; second , the significantly elevated androgen levels in autistic children and their correlation with growth parameters , along with the known anabolic effects of androgens [35] , can compensate for the effects of GH deficiency on physical growth ; and third , even if GH was deficient , the GH receptors of autistic children might have an increased sensitivity that masks the physical effects of GH deficiency .
Additionally , GH deficiency in children is associated with obesity ; subsequently , GH replacement increases lean body mass and reduces body fat content [36] .
Although only one study reported elevated GH levels in autistic children [37] , an earlier study conducted in 1989 [38] revealed that autistic children had a delayed response to GH stimulation via clonidine and L - dopa ; thus , GH may still be deficient in autistic children .
This delayed response can be explained by the dopaminergic deficits and the reduced adrenaline levels in autism [38] .
Findings related to the hormones measured in this study and the suggested hormonal inter - relationships are summarized in Figure 2 .
The current study revealed significantly lower AG , DG and GH levels and significantly higher androgen and leptin levels in children with autism compared with age - and sex - matched healthy controls .
These hormones are inter - related , and they have direct effects on many clinical and pathological aspects of autism .
The role of ghrelin in the pathophysiology of autism should be further studied at molecular levels as well as its implication in autism treatment . role of anti - androgen therapy in autism should also be investigated , as androgens function as the pace - maker for hormonal dysregulation .
Correction of this dysregulation might have a direct influence on both ghrelin and leptin , which in turn affect GH levels .
Investigations of the genetic bases for these phenomena should be conducted in future studies .
The main limitation of this study is the lack of female subjects with autism ; thus , the study was limited to only the male sex .
Additionally , the number of subjects included in the study was not large and was also limited by the availability of both autism patients and controls .
However , in the opinion of the authors , this study contributes significantly to the understanding of hormonal dysregulation in the pathophysiology of autism , as it provides baseline data regarding hormonal profiles in autism and substantiates potential clinical interventions .

There were some errors in Table 2 , the authors would like to make the following corrections .
The baseline postprandial blood glucose level ( mg / dL ) should read 199.1 ± 85.2 , instead of 199.1 ± 1.49 .
The 12 weeks postprandial blood glucose level ( mg / dL ) should read 154.9 ± 60.5 , instead of 54.9 ± 60.5 .
White adipose tissues are functionally heterogeneous and differently manage the excess of energy supply .
While the expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissues ( SAT ) is protective in obesity , that of visceral adipose tissues ( VAT ) correlates with the emergence of metabolic diseases .
Maintained in fat pads throughout life , adipose stem cells ( ASC ) are mesenchymal - like stem cells with adipogenesis and multipotent differentiation potential .
ASC from distinct fat pads have long been reported to present distinct proliferation and differentiation potentials that are maintained in culture , yet the origins of these intrinsic differences are still unknown .
Metabolism is central to stem cell fate decision in line with environmental changes .
In this study , we performed high - resolution nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) metabolomic analyses of ASC culture supernatants in order to characterize their metabolic phenotype in culture .
We identified and quantified 29 ASC exometabolites and evaluated their consumption or secretion over 72 h of cell culture .
Both ASC used glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism , as evidenced by the high secretions of lactate and citrate , respectively , but V - ASC mostly used glycolysis .
By varying the composition of the cell culture medium , we showed that glutaminolysis , rather than glycolysis , supported the secretion of pyruvate , alanine , and citrate , evidencing a peculiar metabolism in ASC cells .
The comparison of the two types of ASC in glutamine - free culture conditions also revealed the role of glutaminolysis in the limitation of pyruvate routing towards the lactate synthesis , in S - ASC but not in V - ASC .
Altogether , our results suggest a difference between depots in the capacity of ASC mitochondria to assimilate pyruvate , with probable consequences on their differentiation potential in pathways requiring an increased mitochondrial activity .
These results highlight a pivotal role of metabolic mechanisms in the discrimination between ASC and provide new perspectives in the understanding of their functional differences .

Introduction
White adipose tissue is an interesting source of multipotent stem cells sharing properties with mesenchymal stem cells and used for clinical applications .
Indeed , in addition to their differentiation potential , adipose stem cells ( ASC ) display stromal functions ( i ) by supporting the growth of other stem cells [1] , ( ii ) by controlling local inflammation through the secretion of cytokines or by the interaction with immune cells [2] , and ( iii ) by controlling energy metabolism pathways by the secretion of hormones such as adiponectin [3] .
For a long time , ASC properties have been used in regenerative medicine and for cell therapy [4] with an increasing interest for the use of their secretome [5] .
However , their contribution to adipose tissue homeostasis and expansion in obesity is not clear , notably due to the functional heterogeneity of adipose fat pads .
White adipose tissue is split into different body regions with two main areas , the subcutaneous ( SAT ) and the visceral ( VAT ) white adipose depots that play distinct roles in the control of energy metabolism .
Indeed , SAT expansion is protective in obesity while VAT expansion promotes the metabolic complications of obesity such as resistance to insulin and type 2 diabetes [6] .
It has been reported that SAT and VAT have distinct functional properties regarding their capacity of fatty acid storage and the control of inflammation [7] .
The metabolic protection by SAT is attributed to its ability to trap free fatty acids through triglyceride esterification ( lipogenesis ) protecting other organs from lipotoxicity [8] while the deleterious effect of expanding VAT is attributed to its higher lipolytic activity favoring the release of free fatty acids [6] and the delivery of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL 6 [9] .
It has been shown that VAT expansion occurs when the storage capacity of SAT is saturated [10] , a process associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation [11] .
Whether this stem cell mobilization , to produce new adipocytes in obesity , is restricted to VAT remains controversial [ 12 , 13 ] , but it reveals distinct metabolic dialogs between stem cells and their environment .
Reinforcing the differences between adipose tissues , functional differences exist between ASC from distinct depots , with ASC from SAT ( S - ASC ) showing higher abilities to proliferate [14] , to survive [ 7 , 15 ] , to accumulate lipids [ 7 , 14 ] , and to differentiate into adipocytes [16-18] than ASC from VAT ( V - ASC ) .
Interestingly , these differences observed with isolated ASC cultivated in vitro are thus intrinsic indicating distinct fate for ASC in distinct adipose depots [14] .
Metabolic adaptation is central to the balance between proliferation and differentiation of stem cells that support tissue homeostasis and adaptation .
It is assumed that proliferating stem cells exhibit a glycolytic metabolic program supporting cell synthesis [19] while the switch to mitochondrial activity and oxidative phosphorylation is required for differentiation [20] .
In multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that can give rise to chondrocytes , osteoblasts , and adipocytes , the switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation further directs the lineage decision between osteogenesis and chondrogenesis according to the requirements of the mature cell phenotype for oxygen supply [21] .
Similarly , ASC , which are intended to generate adipocytes in white adipose tissues , may preferentially depend on metabolic pathways related to fatty acid synthesis .
In this article , to further understand the intrinsic differences between ASC from distinct adipose depots , we addressed their metabolic features .
To reach this goal , we have set up efficient isolation and culture conditions of ASC allowing the amplification of stem cells from SAT and from VAT collected from mice .
The metabolic pathways involved in the maintenance of ASC were defined by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( H - NMR ) .
By quantifying the metabolites in the extracellular culture medium , we measured the consumption and secretion rates of a variety of metabolites to characterize and to compare the metabolic profiles during cell cultures of ASC from distinct adipose depot .
Our results indicate that V - and S - ASC present significant metabolic differences among which the role of glutaminolysis is noticeable .
Our data also shed new light on the balance between glycolysis and mitochondrial activity of ASC under the influence of the depot of origin .

Isolation and Culture of ASC
Mouse studies were performed with the approval of the Regional Committee of Ethics for Animal Experiments .
After one week acclimatization , subcutaneous and epididymal adipose tissues were harvested from 10 - 12 - week - old male C57B L / 6J mice ( Envigo , Gannat , France ) killed by cervical dislocation .
Adipose tissues were removed and left on ice in Hanks ' balanced salt solution ( Dutscher , Brumath , France ) supplemented with 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin ( Gibco , France ) until isolation of adipose - derived stem cells .
The adipose tissues were successively washed with Hanks solution and Dulbecco ' s phosphate balanced solution ( PAA , France ) before being torn into pieces .

Metabolomic Analyses
2.9.1 .
Exometabolome Sample Preparation
Metabolite concentrations were measured in supernatants of ASC placed for the indicated time in culture medium composed of DMEM without glucose , without pyruvate , without glutamine , and without red phenol ( PAN - Biotech , France ) supplemented with 25 mM glucose , antibiotics , 20 % FCS , 25 mM hepes , nonessential amino acid 1x ( PAA , France ) , 4 mM L - glutamine ( Corning , France ) , 1 mM pyruvate ( Dutscher , France ) , 100 μ M ascorbic acid , 5 ng / ml human bFGF , and 5 U / ml heparin sodium .
This medium had the same nutrient composition as the growth culture medium and only differed by the absence of phenol red , the replacement of L - glutamine - L - alanyl ( 2 mM ) by L - glutamine ( 4 mM ) .
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 cells per cm in a 12 - well dish and cultured in 1.5 ml of culture medium .
After 24 h , as the cells reached 70 to 80 percent of confluency , the medium was replaced by 500 μ l of fresh culture medium , and the culture was maintained for 24 , 48 , or 72 h , as indicated in the figure legends .
Culture medium in wells without cells was processed in the same ways to obtain the initial concentrations of metabolites in the medium ( control ) .
For studies examining the role of pyruvate , glucose , and glutamine supplies , cells were seeded as previously indicated and cultivated for 72 h .
At confluency , culture medium was replaced by culture medium without pyruvate nor hepes and supplemented with the indicated concentrations of glucose and glutamine .
The other components were at the concentrations indicated above .
At the end of the culture , supernatants were collected and snap - frozen at - 20 ° C for NMR analyses .
For the preparation of exometabolome samples , 200 μ l of centrifuged cell culture supernatant was supplemented with 400 μ l of phosphate buffer pH 7.4 ( 160 mM NaHPO , 30 mM NaHPO , 1 mM TSP , and 3 mM NaN in 100 % DO ) [22] .
Samples were analyzed in 5 mm NMR tubes containing 550 μ l of the sample mix .
Control culture mediums were analyzed in parallel during each NMR session .

NMR Acquisition
All NMR experiments were acquired on a 600 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe at 30.0 ° C .
A cooled SampleJet autosampler enabled high throughput data acquisition .
A standard H - 1D NMR pulse sequence nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy ( NOESY ) with z - gradient and water presaturation ( Bruker pulse program noesygppr 1d ) was recorded on each sample , with a total of 128 transient free induction decays ( FID ) and a spectral width of 20 ppm , and a relaxation delay was set to 4 seconds .
The NOESY mixing time was set to 10 milliseconds , and the 90 ° pulse length was automatically determined for each sample ( around 13 μ s ) .
The total acquisition time of each sample was 12 minutes and 15 seconds .
2.9.3 .
NMR Data Processing
All free induction decays ( FIDs ) were multiplied by an exponential function corresponding to a 0.3 Hz line - broadening factor prior to Fourier transform H - NMR spectra which were manually phased and referenced to the glucose doublet at 5.23 ppm using TopSpin 2.2 ( Bruker GmbH , Rheinstetten , Germany ) .
TSP was not used for data processing in this study .
For multivariate analyses , residual water signal ( 4.85 - 4.67 ppm ) was excluded .
Spectra were divided into 0.001 ppm - wide buckets over the chemical shift range ( - 0.2 ; 9.5 ppm ) using the AMIX software ( Bruker GmbH ) .

Identification of the metabolites was carried out from the 1D NMR data using the software Chenomx NMR Suite 8.0 ( Chenomx Inc . , Edmonton , Canada ) and confirmed from analysis of 2D H - H TOCSY , H - C HSQC , and H J - Resolved NMR spectra recorded with standard parameters .
The measured chemical shifts were compared to reference shifts of pure compounds using the HMDB database [23] .
Relative metabolite concentrations were determined using Chenomx software by manual fitting of the proton resonance lines for the compounds available in the database .
The linewidth used in the reference database was adjusted to the width of one component of the alanine doublet .
A pure standard lactate solution ( 1 g / l , Fisher ) was used as an external concentration reference and exploited using the ERETIC 2 utility from TopSpin ( Bruker GmbH , Rheinstetten , Germany ) to add a digitally synthesized peak to a spectrum [24] .
Concentrations in the cell culture media are presented as absolute , not normalized data .
They are apparent concentrations , as endogenous and FCS proteins were not removed from the NMR samples .

Multivariate Data Analyses
Multivariate analyses were performed on NMR spectra buckets in the absence of any normalization using SIMCA - P 13 ( Umetrics , Umea , Sweden ) with Pareto scaled variables .
Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was used to derive the main sources of variance within the data set , assess sample homogeneity , and exclude biological or technical outliers .
Orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis ( O - PLS - DA ) was used to build predictive sample classification models .
Results were visualized on score plots , corresponding to sample projections onto the predictive axis and the first orthogonal component of the model , and the associated loading plot .
The optimal number of orthogonal components was selected using a 7 - fold cross - validation procedure .
The R and Q
parameters were computed to estimate the goodness of fit and prediction , i.e. , the explained and predicted variances , respectively .
The O - PLS - DA models were validated using permutations under the null hypothesis ( 1000 times ) ; for each permutated classification labels , R and Q
were recalculated and compared to the original ones , and their decrease indicates the good quality of the model [25] .
Metabolites involved in class discrimination were highlighted with the statistical recoupling of variables ( SRV ) analysis [26] .
SRV corresponds to an automatic binning scheme based on the relationship of correlation and covariance between consecutive variables , which is followed by a univariate unpaired two - tailed t - test calculated for each variable under the Benjamini - Hochberg correction to cope with multiple testing issues [27] .

Phenotypic Analysis and Stem Cell Properties of ASC Populations
S - ASC were isolated from subcutaneous and V - ASC from epididymal white adipose tissues in mice .
ASC grew as monolayers in culture plates ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) .
Starting from the stromal vascular fraction , our culture conditions led to the depletion in CD 45 + and CD 31 + cells representative of the hematopoietic and of the endothelial lineages , respectively , and to the enrichment into CD 45 - and CD 31 - cells at the end of the first passage .
Analysis by flow cytometry showed that these cells were positive for mesenchymal stem cell markers ( Sca 1 , CD 29 , and CD 90 ) [28] , and a fraction of them additionally expressed markers of the adipogenic potency ( CD 140a ) ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) .
However , these cells did not express CD 24 ( not shown ) indicating that they were not committed to adipogenesis [29] .
To confirm the mesenchymal stem cell identity of ASC , their multipotent differentiation potential was assessed [30] .
Figure 2 shows that S - and V - ASC are able to differentiate into chondrocytes and into adipocytes , but only S - ASC can give rise to osteocytes , in accordance with a previous report [31] .
Interestingly , both ASC had comparable efficiency to differentiate into chondrocytes , but V - ASC were less efficient than S - ASC to generate adipocytes .
This was in accordance with the differences described between adipose depots regarding the fatty acid storage function .
Altogether , these data confirm that our culture conditions are suitable to sustain the production of ASC from both SAT and VAT and to preserve their intrinsic functional differences .

Multivariate Statistical Analyses Discriminate S - and V - ASC and Highlight Differentially Secreted Metabolites
To define the best culture conditions to analyze the exometabolome ( the ensemble of metabolites in the extracellular medium ) , we initially performed a comparison of the extracellular metabolite concentration variations over 24 to 72 h of culture ( Figure S1 ) .
Culture supernatants of ASC cultivated during 72 h were analyzed by NMR spectrometry and delivered well - resolved H - NMR metabolic profiles of the exometabolome .
The H - 1D spectra presented typical sharp lines corresponding to small metabolites , overlaid with broad signals from lipids or larger proteins , which appeared negligible in the case of these culture supernatants ( Figure 3 ) .
At 72 h , the steady state in metabolite changes was not reached even for the most proliferative population , S - ASC , except for essential amino acids which were still not depleted in the culture medium .
The steady state in amino acid consumption reached after 48 h corresponded to growth arrest .
These results show that medium replacement did not influence the linear consumption or secretion of metabolites analyzed from 24 to 72 h later and that cells analyzed in the conditions described in this study were still active for the glucose and the glutamine metabolisms .
As S - and V - ASC are known to functionally differ , we conducted multivariate data analyses of their exometabolome after 72 h of culture to identify the NMR spectra regions that correlate with cell types followed by peak identification .
We also used univariate metabolite concentration comparisons to complement the analysis .
Multivariate data analyses were conducted on the NMR spectra bins ( 0.001 ppm ; 9700 NMR spectral variables ) to benefit from the full spectral dynamic range of information .
To get a clear view on the metabolic differences between cell types , while avoiding the complexity induced by the production or consumption status of each metabolite , the analyses were performed on the absolute value of the NMR spectra variation to the original culture medium .
PCA unsupervised multivariate data analyses were first used to evaluate the dataset homogeneity and potential sample class discrimination .
The dataset showed good homogeneity , though one sample from V - ASC appeared as a strong outlier on the PCA score plot and was subsequently removed from further analyses ( this sample presented ethanol contamination , data not shown ) .
A straightforward discrimination between S - ASC and V - ASC was observed on the PCA unsupervised model ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) .
Remarkably , the first principal component of this model could explain alone 68.4 % of the variance within the dataset .
Those untargeted results indicate significant differences of the metabolic profile between both cell types .
To specifically target the NMR regions discriminating S - ASC and V - ASC , a supervised analysis by O - PLS - DA [ 32 , 33 ] was conducted on the 9700 NMR spectral variables .
We obtained a strongly discriminating O - PLS - DA model ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) .
The analysis of NMR regions presenting the most differentially expressed peaks pointed out 10 metabolites which concentration in the culture medium was the most influenced by the presence of the distinct ASC .
Glucose , leucine , valine , glutamine , tyrosine , phenylalanine , lactate , and acetate appeared to vary more in V - ASC than in S - ASC culture supernatants , while citrate and alanine varied more in S - ASC than in V - ASC culture supernatants ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) .
These results define distinct metabolic footprints of V - and S - ASC on their microenvironment and suggest metabolic differences between both cell types .
3.3 .
Depot - Specific Features of ASC Metabolic Signatures
Careful analysis of the H - 1D and 2D H - H and H - C NMR spectra provided the identification of 29 metabolites that were present in the S - and V - ASC supernatants after 72 h culture and that belong to a variety of biochemical classes ( amino acids , sugars , and metabolic intermediates ) .
We did not detect cell type - specific metabolites , but concentrations determined using the Chenomx software revealed quantitative differences ( Table S1 ) .
A scheme illustrating the main anabolic and catabolic pathways and key metabolites is presented in Figure 4 ( d ) .
In this study , we analyzed changes at a given time in the composition of the cell culture supernatants in comparison with the cell - free culture medium placed in the same conditions .
Different from the intracellular compartment , the cell culture supernatant is not a homeostatic compartment .
As a consequence , the exometabolome analyzed in this study does not reflect the status of the cells at a time but rather the addition of successive changes induced by the cellular activity during culture for a given period .
Therefore , the correlation between the exometabolite concentrations in the cell culture supernatants and the number of cells at a given time is not linear .
That is why all the results presented in the manuscript are metabolite concentrations in the culture supernatants without any normalization and for a given period of time .
However , a major attention was paid to the number of cells to minimize the contribution of this parameter to the results .
Glucose and glutamine were the most consumed substrates , and their transformation products , lactate and glutamate , were among the most secreted metabolites , along with citrate and alanine ( Figures 5 ( a ) , Figure S1 ) .
When considering glycolysis , the consumption of glucose mirrored the production of lactate indicating active glycolysis in ASC .
The high level of lactate secretion demonstrates a high aerobic glycolytic activity in both S - and V - ASC .
This singularity was previously described as the Warburg - like effect , a type of noncancer cell metabolism associated with self - renewing stem cells [34] .
On the opposite , the consumption of glutamine generated few amounts of glutamate , indicating that the carbons generated from glutaminolysis were directed elsewhere , most probably towards the production of additional metabolites and cell growth , as suggested by the strong amino acid consumptions supporting the anabolism associated with protein synthesis ( Table S1 ) .
Indeed , essential amino acids ( EAAs ) , which cannot be synthetized in mammalian cells , such as phenylalanine , histidine , and threonine , branched chain essential amino acids ( BCAAs : valine , leucine , and isoleucine ) , and even the semi - EAA tyrosine were similarly consumed by both ASC ( Table S1 ) .
The consumption of EAA is essential and inherent to proliferating cells , but the secretion rather than incorporation of glutamate and alanine ( Figures 5 ( a ) ) suggests an excess of these amino acid production regarding protein synthesis in the context of stem cells .
This ensemble of observations highlights a high glycolysis associated to a Warburg - like effect and glutaminolysis activity in ASC , typical of cells in active division as confirmed by the cell count along several passages ( Figure 5 ( c ) ) .
However , interesting differences were observed between the two ASC populations .
V - ASC secreted higher lactate concentrations and S - ASC higher citrate concentrations in culture supernatants ( Figures 5 ( a ) ) .
Illustrating the mitochondrial activity , citrate is a metabolite produced by the tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) cycle .
The citrate produced by the TCA pathway inside the mitochondria can be further processed as a substrate for ATP production or partly exported to the cytoplasm to fuel the de novo lipid biosynthesis pathway ( Figure 3 ( d ) ) , a feature required to the neosynthesis of membranes of highly proliferating cells [35] .
These intracellular metabolite fluctuations are beyond the scope of this study .
Both lactate and citrate are features of highly proliferating stem cells and are , respectively , representative of the use of pyruvate in glycolysis and in the mitochondrial TCA cycle .
A high level of glycolysis is the signature of undifferentiated cells [36] while citrate can be used for de novo lipogenesis to support the synthesis of new cell membranes [35] .
The comparison of S - and V - ASC growth curves shows that V - ASC proliferated slower than S - ASC and generated at the third passage about 10 - fold less cells ( Figure 5 ( c ) ) despite a higher glycolytic activity .
After the third passage , S - ASC entered the exponential growth phase while V - ASC proliferation started to decline ( Figure 5 ( c ) ) .
In this study , cells were used at passage 2 where the cell number in both populations was still quite similar as shown in Figure 5 ( b ) ruling out the influence of the number of cells in the lower citrate secretion by V - ASC .
Therefore , the difference in the balance between lactate and citrate secretions is a key feature of the difference between S - and V - ASC that suggests distinct uses of pyruvate between the two populations .
Pyruvate diversion away from the mitochondria is an active process differentiating cancer and noncancer stem cells [37] .
UCP 2 has been evidenced as a gatekeeper of pyruvate entry into the mitochondria that limits mitochondrial catabolism of pyruvate [38] and promotes oxidation of alternative substrates such as glutamine and fatty acids [39] .
Preventing OXPHOS activation , UCP 2 expressed in embryonic stem cells favors their maintenance and is repressed as pluripotency is lost [40] .
Measurements of Ucp 2 transcripts ( Figure 5 ( d ) ) and UCP 2 protein ( Figures 5 ( d ) ) in ASC revealed the higher expression in V - ASC than in S - ASC , which is consistent in V - ASC cells with a reduced pyruvate routing into the mitochondria , an elevated lactate secretion , and a majored role of glycolysis for ATP production .
Altogether , ASC present the characteristics of proliferating stem cells , with a Warburg - like effect , associated with active amino acid consumption and a specific feature concerning both an elevated citrate secretion and a high glutamine consumption / low glutamate secretion .
However , compared with S - ASC , V - ASC metabolism supports a stronger Warburg - like effect and a lower TCA cycle activity .
This imbalance may account for the lower ability of V - ASC to differentiate into adipocytes and their inability to give rise to osteoblasts compared with S - ASC ( Figure 2 ) .
Indeed , both differentiation pathways require an increased mitochondrial activity [41] and , for osteogenesis and bone formation , the accumulation of citrate and the inhibition of glycolysis [21] [42] .
On the contrary , chondrogenesis , which predominantly uses the glycolytic metabolism as a source of ATP [21] , was obtained from both S - and V - ASC ( Figure 2 ) .
3.4 .
Glutamine Is a Key Player in the Control of Pyruvate Routing in ASC
To better characterize the S - and V - ASC metabolic differences , cells were cultivated in partially depleted culture media .
The Warburg - like effect and the citrate production involve , respectively , the glycolysis pathway and mitochondrial TCA cycle .
To decipher the respective contributions of glucose and glutamine as sources of carbon in ASC , we performed end - point experiments with cells cultivated for 96 h , in culture media completely or partially depleted in glucose and / or glutamine during the last 24 h .
The replacement of the medium and the measurement on a short period and on cells at confluency were chosen to avoid the influence of substrate depletion in other metabolites than glutamine and glucose .
As expected , partial or total depletion of glutamine and / or glucose affected the final number of cells .
We made the choice to present metabolite concentrations without normalization on cell number because they reflected the loss of cells and do not represent what happened before .
Complete results are available in Table S2 .
Because pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis and a substrate for the TCA cycle , these experiments were performed in pyruvate - free medium to evaluate the respective contributions of glucose and glutamine to pyruvate secretions .
For both S - and V - ASC , the secretion of lactate was dependent on glucose availability ( Figure 6 ( a ) , left and right panels , respectively ) .
Indeed , in the absence of glucose , no lactate was secreted in the culture supernatants .
On the contrary , in the absence of glucose , cells consumed the little amount of lactate initially present in the medium .
Importantly , glutamine privation completely switched the metabolism of S - ASC , but not V - ASC , towards lactate synthesis .
Indeed , in glutamine - free medium , lactate secretion by S - ASC increased from 6.0 ± 0.7 mM to 11.0 ± 1 mM , but glucose uptake decreased from 12.1 ± 1.1 mM to 8.0 ± 0.15 mM ( Figure 6 ( a ) .
This could reflect a more efficient conversion of glucose into lactate by S - ASC in the absence of glutamine , probably at the expense of the alternative uses of glucose molecules , and indicated that glycolysis in S - ASC , but not in V - ASC , was sensitive to glutamine availability .
Modulating glutamine and / or glucose supply in the culture media without pyruvate revealed that the release of pyruvate , citrate , and alanine was dose - dependently correlated with glutamine concentration but not with glucose concentrations in S - and V - ASC .
Only complete glucose deprivation decreased pyruvate secretion but to a lesser extent than in the absence of glutamine ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) .
Pyruvate is an intermediate metabolite of many pathways .
It is the end product of glycolysis that can be converted into alanine by transamination and into lactate through lactate synthesis or can enter the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to produce citrate .
The partial ( V - ASC ) or total ( S - ASC ) independence of citrate and alanine secretions regarding glycolysis ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) further underlines the unexpected contribution of glutaminolysis for glucose consumption .
The lack of pyruvate release in the absence of glutamine indicated an increase of pyruvate consumption by both ASC .
Since citrate and alanine secretions were decreased in the absence of glutamine ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) , we can conclude that the consumed pyruvate was not used to feed the TCA cycle nor for alanine synthesis .
Accordingly , in the case of S - ASC , pyruvate seemed to be redirected to lactate synthesis , raising the Warburg - like effect to levels comparable to those obtained with V - ASC in complete medium .
We did not detect a clear dose response relationship between glutamate secretion and glutamine uptake , indicating that glutamate secretion in ASC is not exclusively linked to glutamine metabolism .
Glucose depletion in the medium did not affect glutamate secretion nor glutamine consumption .
This indicated that glycolysis was not involved in the control of glutaminolysis ( Figure 6 ( c ) ) .
These results indicate that glutaminolysis is central for the use of pyruvate in TCA cycle and in the synthesis of alanine in ASC .
In S - ASC only , glutamine privation also leads to a drastic switch of pyruvate consumption towards lactate production , exacerbating the Warburg - like effect .
Our results reveal that sensitivity to glutamine availability is a key feature discriminating both ASC populations and evidence a complex situation where glutamine could be used as an alternative source of carbon and / or where glutaminolysis could control the fate of glycolysis products .
Further analyses involving fluxomics experiments and isotope labeling will be required to finely dissect the underlying mechanisms involved .

Conclusion
Altogether , our results show that ASC have a mixed metabolism based on both glycolysis and mitochondrial activity , similar to what was already reported for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [21] .
Interestingly , we show that glutaminolysis controls pyruvate consumption for use in TCA cycle and for alanine synthesis .
Importantly , glutaminolysis also prevents the use of pyruvate for lactate production in S - ASC , but not in V - ASC .
The apparent lack of this regulation level in V - ASC is compatible with the preferential use of pyruvate for lactate synthesis , probably at the expense of the mitochondrial activity , in these cells .
As a consequence , S - and V - ASC can be discriminated by their relative secretion of lactate and citrate , lactate being more secreted by V - ASC and citrate by S - ASC .
To our knowledge , this study is the first one to describe at the metabolic level the differences between adipose - derived stem cells isolated from distinct adipose depots .
Our results raise the possibility that mechanisms controlling the flux of pyruvate towards the synthesis of either lactate in the cytoplasm or citrate in the mitochondria could be related to the reported differences between S - and V - ASC in their proliferation and differentiation potentials .
In the light of our results , the correlation between the emergence of pathologies related to the metabolic syndrome and the opposite changes affecting the expansion of the subcutaneous and the visceral adipose tissues may reflect a disruption of the metabolic program supporting ASC at the expense of their original functions .
Future challenge will be to characterize the mechanisms supporting the specific metabolism of ASC in each fat depot and the conditions leading to their breaking .

Having previously used functional MRI to map the response to a reward signal in the ventral caudate in awake unrestrained dogs , here we examined the importance of signal source to canine caudate activation .
Hand signals representing either incipient reward or no reward were presented by a familiar human ( each dog ’ s respective handler ) , an unfamiliar human , and via illustrated images of hands on a computer screen to 13 dogs undergoing voluntary fMRI .
All dogs had received extensive training with the reward and no - reward signals from their handlers and with the computer images and had minimal exposure to the signals from strangers .
All dogs showed differentially higher BOLD response in the ventral caudate to the reward versus no reward signals , and there was a robust effect at the group level .
Further , differential response to the signal source had a highly significant interaction with a dog ’ s general aggressivity as measured by the C - BARQ canine personality assessment .
Dogs with greater aggressivity showed a higher differential response to the reward signal versus no - reward signal presented by the unfamiliar human and computer , while dogs with lower aggressivity showed a higher differential response to the reward signal versus no - reward signal from their handler .
This suggests that specific facets of canine temperament bear more strongly on the perceived reward value of relevant communication signals than does reinforcement history , as each of the dogs were reinforced similarly for each signal , regardless of the source ( familiar human , unfamiliar human , or computer ) .
A group - level psychophysiological interaction ( PPI ) connectivity analysis showed increased functional coupling between the caudate and a region of cortex associated with visual discrimination and learning on reward versus no - reward trials .
Our findings emphasize the sensitivity of the domestic dog to human social interaction , and may have other implications and applications pertinent to the training and assessment of working and pet dogs .
Introduction
The domestic dog is a rising star in behavioral neuroscience due both to his high trainability and likely co - evolution with humans over the last 10,000 - 30,000 years .
Recently , dogs have even proved amenable to participation in awake , unrestrained neuroimaging , allowing researchers to further probe the workings of the canine mind in a non - invasive and ethical method ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2012 ) .
The picture that is emerging suggests dogs are highly sensitive to social context and cues , both from other dogs and from humans .
Unsurprisingly for a highly social species , dogs use an extensive and nuanced vocabulary of cues in both affiliative and antagonistic interactions with conspecifics ( Bradshaw & Nott , 1995 ; Quaranta , Siniscalchi & Vallortigara , 2007 ; Horowitz , 2009 ; Siniscalchi et al . , 2013 ) ; they are perhaps more unique in their apparent interspecies sociality ( Siniscalchi et al . , 2010 ) , showing sensitivity to human cues as well .
It has even been suggested that dogs might serve as better comparative models for human cognition than non - human apes ( Topal et al . , 2009 ) .
They can perform fast mapping of novel words ( Kaminski , Call & Fischer , 2004 ) , and appear to have brain regions specialized for processing the human voice ( Andics et al . , 2014 ) .
Behavioral work shows that dogs can read naturalistic signals from humans that may be difficult for other species ( Hare & Tomasello , 2005 ; Teglas et al . , 2012 ; Gacsi et al . , 2013 ) ( although see Udell , Dorey & Wynne , 2010 ) .
Prior fMRI research in our lab has shown that the ventral caudate nucleus - a brain region known to be specialized for reward prediction and processing of positively valenced stimuli across species ( Schultz , Tremblay & Hollerman , 2000 ; Montague & Berns , 2002 ; Humphries & Prescott , 2010 ; Daw et al . , 2011 ) - is differentially active in dogs in response to the scent of familiar humans versus familiar dogs and unfamiliar humans ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , in press ) .
In line with behavioral evidence ( Miklosi & Topal , 2013 ) , this suggests that , in a real sense , dogs may prefer the company of familiar humans over the company of either familiar or unfamiliar dogs .
While the amassing data are suggestive of specialized social sensitivity in the dog , the question remains to what extent simple conditioning and reinforcement history , as opposed to social specialization , can explain previous findings .
To address one aspect of this question , we iterated on and expanded our earlier fMRI work with dogs .
Having previously shown a replicable but heterogeneous ventral caudate response in dogs to signals from their handlers predicting either incipient food reward or no reward ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2012 ; Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2013 ) , here we used fMRI to examine neural responses to these same signals presented by a familiar human and an unfamiliar human and to analogous but illustrated hand signals projected on a screen ( referred to forthwith as “ computer ” signals ) .
Although the subject dogs had an extensive reinforcement history with the human and computer signals , we hypothesized that differential caudate BOLD response in the reward versus no - reward condition - taken here to be indicative of strength of reward prediction - would be highest with the familiar human source , and lowest with the computer , in line with the possibility that social bond , and not just food - specific reinforcement history , affects the valence of familiar cues .
There is growing evidence to suggest that human - dog social bonds are durable and complex , showing much of the same nuance as those of human - human social bonds ( e.g. , Prato - Previde et al . , 2003 ; Siniscalchi , Stipo & Quaranta , 2013 ) .
It is possible then that the source of a signal might indeed have a profound effect on how it is received and processed by a dog .
To examine possible effects of temperament on conditional neural response , we also collected CBARQ questionnaires ( a validated method for quantifying dog temperament Duffy & Serpell , 2012 ) from each dog ’ s primary handler .
Finally , we conducted an exploratory psychophysiological interaction ( PPI ) analysis on the BOLD data .
PPI is a connectivity measure that allows one to examine what brain areas increase functional connectivity ( i.e. , synchronous fluctuations of brain activity Biswal et al . , 1995 ) with a seed region on a task or condition - specific basis .
While typical BOLD contrasts used in fMRI tend to highlight regions maximally specific to the task or condition of interest , PPI can highlight more distributed network activity involving areas less specialized to the primary task ( Friston et al . , 1997 ; Rogers et al . , 2007 ) .
PPI generally requires large numbers of events , so we collapsed across all source conditions ( familiar human , unfamiliar human , and computer ) and looked for areas with increased functional connectivity to the ventral caudate in the reward vs . no - reward conditions .
This opens the possibility of uncovering task - specific reward networks across the canine brain .
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants were dogs ( n = 13 ) from the Atlanta community ( Table 1 ) .
All were pets and / or released service dogs whose owners volunteer their time for fMRI training and experiments .
All had previously completed an fMRI session in which two hand signals were presented by their primary trainer , one indicating forthcoming food reward , the other indicating no reward .
Accordingly , all dogs had demonstrated an ability to remain still during training and scanning for periods of 30 s or greater .
However , one dog exhibited excessive motion during this experiment and was subsequently excluded from analysis because of insufficient observations after motion censoring ( see below ) .
Participants .
This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health .
The study was approved by the Emory University IACUC ( Protocol # DAR - 2001274 - 120814BA ) , and all dogs ’ owners gave written consent for participation in the study .
Training
For participation in previous experiments ( details in : Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2013 ; Berns , Brooks & Spivak , in press ) , dogs took part in a training program using behavior shaping , desensitization , habituation , and behavior chaining to prepare them to be comfortable with the physical confines of the MRI bore and the loud noise produced by scanning .
The end goal of initial training was that each dog remain comfortable and motionless for up to 30 s at a time during live scanning .
In the current experiment , dogs received reward and no reward signals from a familiar human ( their primary experimental trainer ) , an unfamiliar human , and from computer - generated stimuli on a projection screen .
As mentioned above , each dog in this experiment was highly trained on two hand signals , an upright raised left hand signifying reward , and both hands held sideways and inward - pointing , with the back of each hand toward the dog , signifying no reward ( as described in Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2012 ) .
No further training for these signals was required .
The current experiment involved two new experimental stimuli : computer - generated images to be presented on a projection screen .
These were to serve the same signaling function as the previously learned hand signals ( reward and no - reward ) .
The computer reward signal consisted of an illustrated image of a raised hand , oriented so it would appear as a raised left hand facing the dog .
The computer no - reward signal consisted of two illustrated inward pointing hands with thumbs up , oriented to appear as if the backs of the hands were facing the dog ( Fig . 1 ) .
For maximum discriminability , the two signals were presented on black backgrounds , and each at one of the wavelengths to which dogs are most sensitive ( Neitz , Geist & Jacobs , 1989 ) , a yellow - green for the reward signal ( 555 nm ) , and a medium blue ( 429 nm ) for the no - reward signal .
Wavelengths were converted RGB values ( http://rohanhill.com/tools/WaveToRGB/ ) .
Because we were not making predictions about visual processing , but rather wanted two stimuli that were maximally discriminable , we did not attempt to normalize the contrast and luminance of the two computer stimuli .
Training for the current experiment involved biweekly instruction at our training facility overseen by core project staff and regular training at home overseen by each dogs ’ primary experimental trainer .
Dogs were trained to associate the green raised hand signal with reward and the sideways blue hand signal with no reward via the same method previously employed to teach them the human hand signals ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2013 ) .
During training sessions , each dog cooperatively stationed him - or herself in a custom - made foam chinrest placed inside of a mock MRI coil .
Presentation of signals was contingent on the dog ’ s being able to station calmly and with minimal motion .
The signals were displayed on a laptop screen placed approximately 20 inches in front of the dog , and were presented in short ( < 20 trials ) sessions .
Presentation order was semi - randomized ( each signal was presented no more than 4 times consecutively , and reward to no - reward ratio was between 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 , with the reward signal becoming less frequent once each dog became comfortable and experienced with the protocol ) .
If the dog was able to hold still for the duration of the green reward hand signal , a food reward was dispensed immediately after .
Following the blue sideways hand signal , no reward was dispensed .
If the dog left the station during either signal , the stimulus was turned off , and the handler waited until the dog returned , at which point they presented the same stimulus again .
Association learning with the two computer stimuli was conducted over multiple sessions and for an amount of time comparable to initial training with the human hand signals ( approximately 1 month ) .
When dogs were accustomed to viewing the computer signals , further training was conducted at our training facility .
First , dogs were acclimated to a new food - delivery system ( dubbed the “ treat - kabob ” ) .
This was necessary because , while previously food reward had been delivered directly by hand , in the current experiment the projection screen required for presentation of the computer stimuli made this difficult .
Furthermore , we wished to evaluate only the context variability of the signals .
Therefore , we needed to keep the food delivery methodology constant across the three signal source states .
Two variants of the food - delivery system were used - one in which a long wooden dowel with a small treat placed on a dull skewer at the end was slid up a PVC pipe and presented to the dog , and another in which the same dowel was used to bring the treat to the dog ’ s mouth without the PVC guide tube ( the specific delivery method was adjusted for the dog ’ s comfort ) .
In both cases , dogs were first exposed to the treat kabob in their chin stations on the ground until it was determined they were not nervous and were competent at removing the treats from the skewer .
Training was then transitioned into the mock MRI scanner ( Fig . 2A , see Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2013 ) .
In 1 - 3 sessions with each dog ’ s primary experimental trainer presenting the familiar reward and no - reward hand signals , food reward was delivered via the treat kabob by a project staff member sitting below and to the side of the bore .
Each dog also received one or two sessions with an unfamiliar human delivering the reward and no - reward hand signals , to assess their willingness to remain stationary in the presence of an unfamiliar human .
Note that the human used in this behavioral assessment was different than the unfamiliar human who delivered signals at testing .
When dogs were judged comfortable with this setup , training commenced for acclimation to a screen being placed in the bore .
A computer monitor was placed at the end of the bore , directly in front of the dog ’ s chin station , to simulate the projection screen used in live scanning .
These training sessions were aimed at making the dogs comfortable with stationing in the bore with a visual barrier in front of them .
We did not have a strict behavioral metric to determine when this training was complete - rather a practical measure was used .
Dogs were cleared for testing when they had completed at least one month of regular practice and were able to do an extended “ dress rehearsal ” session in the mock scanner without showing anxiety or escape behavior .
This session involved stationing with the monitor in place , recorded scanner noise playing , and the primary handler out of view .
Dogs also had to be wearing their ear protection , and treats were delivered via the treat kabob .
Total time in training , from first introduction to the computer stimuli to finishing “ dress rehearsal ” ranged from 8 weeks to 16 weeks , with the duration affected by both the aptitude of the dog and the diligence of the owner in implementing homework sessions .
MRI scanning
All scanning for the current experiment was conducted with a Siemens 3 T Trio whole - body scanner .
Dogs were stationed in their custom chin - rests , which had been placed in a standard neck coil as previously described in Berns , Brooks & Spivak ( 2013 ) ( Fig . 2B ) .
All participants wore ear protection during scanning , either Mutt Muffs ™ or ear plugs with wrap , depending on dog and owner preference .
Each scan session began with a 3 s , single image localizer in the sagittal plane ( SPGR sequence , slice thickness = 4 mm , TR = 9.2 ms , TE = 4.15 ms , flip angle = 40 ° , 256 × 256 matrix , FOV = 220 mm ) .
A T2 - weighted structural image was previously acquired during one of our earlier experiments using a turbo spin - echo sequence ( 25 - 30 2 mm slices , TR = 3,940 ms , TE = 8.9 ms , flip angle = 131 ° , 26 echo trains , 128 × 128 matrix , FOV = 192 mm ) , which lasted ∼ 30 s .
Functional scans used a single - shot echo - planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence to acquire volumes of 24 sequential 3 mm slices with a 10 % gap ( TE = 28 ms , TR = 1,400 ms , flip angle = 70 ° , 64 × 64 matrix , 3 mm in - plane voxel size , FOV = 192 mm ) .
Slices were oriented dorsally to the dog ’ s brain ( coronal to the magnet , as , in the sphinx position , the dogs ’ heads were positioned 90 ° from the usual human orientation ) with the phase - encoding direction right - to - left .
Sequential slices were used to minimize between - plane offsets from participant movement , and the 10 % slice gap minimized the crosstalk that can occur with sequential scan sequences .
Six runs of up to 300 functional volumes were acquired , each lasting approximately 6 min .
For the first dog ( Zen ) , three runs of up to 600 functional volumes were acquired , each lasting approximately 12 min .
This was subsequently split into 6 runs in a counterbalanced fashion for the remainder of the dogs .
As part of a separate experiment , an additional functional run was acquired during the session in which the dog was presented with different types of visual stimuli on the screen ; however , these data are not analyzed or reported here .
During functional scanning , reward was delivered via the aforementioned treat - kabob , operated by a project staff member sitting below and to the side of the scanner bore ( out of sight of the dog ) .
Experimental design
Stimuli for this experiment were as described above : the two natural hand signals representing reward and no - reward delivered by a familiar and an unfamiliar human , and the two illustrated computer signals representing reward and no - reward , projected on a screen at the head of the bore .
Each subject dog received 15 reward and 15 no - reward signals with the familiar human , the unfamiliar human , and with the computer images , for 90 trials overall across the three source conditions .
Each stimulus was presented for approximately 10 s , regardless of source .
These 90 trials were broken into six runs of 15 trials each .
An event - based design was used , with reward and no - reward trials presented semi - randomly within each run ( either 7 reward trial and 8 no - reward trials or vice versa , and with no more than three of either stimulus type presented consecutively ) .
The six runs for each dog were always in the same order : familiar human , unfamiliar human , computer , computer , unfamiliar human , familiar human ( as part of a different experiment , an additional run was included in the middle of this sequence in which different visual stimuli were presented on the computer screen and are analyzed and reported elsewhere ) .
Low sample size didn ’ t allow for different counterbalancing across participants or randomizing order , and running each source condition on a separate day to avoid effects from in - session habituation was not practical .
This ABCCBA pattern of presentation controlled , at least partially , for effects in the BOLD signal from habituation , sensitization , and scanner drift becoming confounded with signal source .
In addition , we determined that placing the computer runs first or last might be difficult for some dogs - in practice we had observed that dogs tended to move more and show more signs of anxiety when receiving computer signals as opposed to receiving signals directly from their handlers .
By placing the computer signals in the middle of the experimental sequence , each dog had a chance to “ warm up ” to the task with the more familiar source conditions before the computer runs , but also had the more familiar ( potentially easier ) source conditions at the end of the experimental sequence , when stress and fatigue may have made them less inclined to continue participating .
The first dog ’ s 90 trials were broken instead into three runs of 30 trials each ( 15 reward and 15 no - reward ) , in the following order : familiar , unfamiliar , computer .
Thus , he received the same amount of total trials and trials for each condition as the other dogs , but without the pyramidal order provided the other dogs .
Behavioral criteria during testing for all dogs were the same as during training - each dog was required to hold still for the duration of each signal .
Following a reward signal , they received a small piece of hot - dog via the treat - kabob .
No reward was given following a no - reward signal .
Following each 15 - trial run , the dog was taken out of the scanner and allowed to walk around , drink water , etc .
For live scanning , some dogs did show some anxiety when first placed in the bore with the projection screen in place and their handler out of sight .
Basic training mechanisms were employed to work around this , reprising the initial acclimation approach taken in the mock scanner at our training facility discussed previously .
In brief , prior to the beginning of these scanner runs , the dogs were stationed with the screen present and their owner ’ s face in view .
They were rewarded a number of times as the owner was approximated back and to the side , and then live scanning began .
Event recording
Trial events ( onset and offset of reward and no - reward signals ) were recorded by an observer via a four - button MRI - compatible button - box .
The observer stood next to the experimental trainer and unfamiliar person respectively on runs 1 , 2 , 5 , and 6 , such that they could see the dog ’ s head in the bore of the magnet .
On these runs , the observer signaled the experimental trainer and unfamiliar person when to present which signal .
On runs 3 and 4 , the computer runs , the observer moved to the side so that the dog was unable to see them , but the they could just see the very tip of the dog ’ s nose ( to ascertain that the dog was still appropriately stationed / not moving ) .
On the computer runs , the observer used the button - box to present and advance the reward and no - reward stimuli ( while simultaneously recording onset / offset ) .
A laptop computer running Matlab ( MathWorks ) and Cogent ( FIL , University College London ) was connected to the button - box via serial port , and recorded both the button - box responses by the observer and scanner sequence pulses .
C - BARQ
Because we hypothesized that variability in participant disposition toward handlers and strangers could have a strong impact on the relative reward value of the two signal types across different source conditions the dogs ’ handlers completed the Canine Behavioral Assessment & Research Questionnaires ( C - BARQ ) .
These have been used on over 20,000 dogs and represent a standardized and validated ( Duffy & Serpell , 2012 ) tool for obtaining behavioral measures from owner report .
The C - BARQ consists of 101 questions asking the respondent to report on how the dog typically responds to common events .
Scores between 0 ( minimum ) and 5 ( maximum ) are then computed for 14 behavioral categories .
Because of the small number of dogs relative to the number of C - BARQ factors , there was a high potential for factors to be correlated with each other .
This collinearity , combined with the number of factors , would be problematic in any modeling of the neural data .
Therefore , we performed principal component analysis ( PCA ) on the 14 C - BARQ scores from our subjects , with a limit of four factors .
By limiting to four factors , we were able to include these factors in the neural model without overfitting , while still being able to identify the major groupings of C - BARQ dimensions that were responsible for differences in neural activation .
Functional data preprocessing and analysis
Preprocessing was conducted using AFNI ( NIH ) and its associated functions , and most steps were identical to those listed in Berns , Brooks & Spivak ( in press ) .
In brief , 2 - pass , 6 - parameter affine motion correction was used with a hand - selected reference volume for each dog .
Because dogs moved between trials ( and when rewarded ) , aggressive censoring was carried out , relying on a combination of outlier voxels in terms of signal intensity and estimated motion .
Censored files were inspected visually to be certain that bad volumes ( e.g. , when the dog ’ s head was out of the scanner ) were not included .
The majority of censored volumes followed the consumption of food .
On average , 51 % of total EPI volumes were retained for each subject ( ranging from 38 % to 60 % ) .
This was in line with previous experiments using reward and no - reward signals ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2013 ; Berns , Brooks & Spivak , in press ) .
In addition , we computed the scan - to - scan movement from the AFNI motion files in all three principal directions during exposure to each source ( handler , stranger , computer ) and condition ( reward and no - reward ) for each dog for all volumes , including those subsequently censored .
Scan - to - scan movement was computed as : sqrt ( inline - formula ) where dx , dy , and dz are the changes in corresponding head position of the ith volume ( e.g. , dx = x − xi ) .
Scan - to - scan movements greater than 10 mm occurred occasionally if a dog moved out of the field of view .
In these cases , the motion estimates were not reliable and so these values were capped at 10 mm to avoid biasing the average .
We also computed the proportion of censored volumes during exposure to each source and condition .
This allowed us to determine whether unbalanced motion parameters or censoring between reward and no - reward conditions might introduce strong bias into our BOLD findings .
EPI images were smoothed and normalized to % - signal change .
Smoothing was applied using 3dmerge , with a 6 mm kernel at Full - Width Half - Maximum ( FWHM ) .
The resulting images were then input into the General Linear Model .
For each subject , a General Linear Model was estimated for each voxel using 3dDeconvolve .
The task - related regressors in this model were : ( 1 ) familiar human reward signal , ( 2 ) familiar human no - reward signal , ( 3 ) unfamiliar human reward signal , ( 4 ) unfamiliar human no - reward signal , ( 5 ) computer reward signal , and ( 6 ) computer no - reward signal .
Because our previous work measuring the hemodynamic response function ( hrf ) in dogs on this task revealed a peak response at 4 - 6 s after signal onset ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2012 ) , the six task regressors were modeled as impulse functions .
Events were convolved with a single gamma function approximating the hrf .
Motion regressors generated by the motion correction were also included in the model to further control for motion effects .
A constant and linear drift term was included for each run .
Finally , to control for possibly confounding physiological factors ( e.g. , if the reward condition led to more rapid breathing , which might boost neural BOLD signal ) , a spherical ROI ( 3 mm radius ) was drawn manually on each dog ’ s structural image in the posterior ventricle , just posterior to the splenium of the corpus callosum .
Using AFNI ’ s 3dmaskave , average timecourses for these ROIs were then extracted after transforming to each dog ’ s structural space .
This timecourse was entered into the general model as a nuisance variable for each subject .
Because BOLD signal changes in CSF and white matter reflect physiological effects , not neural processing , this controlled for undue influence of physiological effects on the primary contrasts ( Weissenbacher et al . , 2009 ; Murphy , Birn & Bandettini , 2013 ) .
ROIs and mixed - effects modeling
To measure the interaction of reward and no - reward signals with signal source , we used a mixed - effects ANOVA to compare mean caudate activation in the six conditions ( 2 signals × 3 sources ) across all dogs .
The four primary temperament factors ( as computed from the CBARQ behavioral questionnaire and subsequent PCA discussed above ) were also included in the statistical model .
To ensure that we were , in fact , measuring caudate activity , we used anatomically defined ROIs .
A left and right ROI was drawn on each dog ’ s structural image ( Fig . 3 ) .
Then , these ROIs were used to extract average beta values for each dog in each condition from the first - level GLMs , after transforming to each dog ’ s structural space .
The end result was 12 values for each dog ( the 6 conditions for both left and right caudates ) .
Analysis was conducted using the Mixed Models procedure in SPSS v 21 ( IBM ) .
A 2 × 3 ANOVA was formulated with fixed effects for hand signal ( reward , no reward ) and source ( familiar , unfamiliar , computer ) with dog as a random effect .
Because no significant left / right differences were observed , side was not included as a fixed effect .
We also conducted a second analysis that included the C - BARQ temperament factors as well their interactions with the other fixed effects .
This allowed us to determine the relative caudate activation in each of the six conditions and examine how this might be modulated by temperament .
PPI
In addition , we used our data to compute a psychophysiological interaction ( PPI ) analysis at the individual and group levels .
PPI highlights areas that increase functional coupling ( defined as synchronous firing patterns ) with a seed area in a certain condition , or in a certain condition in contrast to some other ( Friston et al . , 1997 ) , and has been shown to produce reliable and robust measures of task - specific functional connectivity ( Kim & Hortwitz , 2008 ) .
PPI allows one to determine which brain areas increase functional connectivity with an area of interest during processing of a specific task .
We computed our PPI in AFNI as described in http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/sscc/gangc/CD-CorrAna.html .
First , functionally localized , bilateral caudate seeds were generated for each dog from the allrew - allnorew contrast ( that is , across all three source conditions : familiar , unfamiliar , and computer ) .
For each animal , the seeds were generated as spheres with a 3 mm radius centered on the voxel with the greatest differential activation in the left and right caudate respectively .
The activation time series for the left and right caudate seeds were extracted for each subject using 3dmaskave .
The time series were then deconvolved using 3dDetrend using a basic gamma function .
Next , the interaction of the condition times ( reward , no reward , and neutral baseline ) and the deconvolved caudate seed time series was computed to produce an interaction term .
The interaction term was convolved using the AFNI waver command with a basic gamma function .
The convolved interaction term and the initial extracted caudate seed time series were then entered as regressors into the initial GLM ( along with the primary task regressors , drift terms , motion regressors ) , and physiological regressor ) .
Increased BOLD activation corresponding to the interaction term in the GLM should then be seen in areas that increased functional coupling ( i.e. , synchronous firing ) with the caudate during reward versus no - reward conditions .
Such areas may be understood to be differentially connected to the caudate during processing of the reward signal in this task .
Note that , as a connectivity analysis , PPI is driven by patterns of increase and decrease in BOLD signal , and is not necessarily indicative of a main effect difference in BOLD strength in any particular region .
Whole - brain group analyses
To apply the transformations to a statistical contrast , the appropriate individual - level contrast ( obtained from the GLM as described above ) was extracted from the AFNI BRIK file and normalized to template space .
Group normalization was conducted using the Advanced Normalization Tools ( ANTs ) software , as described in Berns , Brooks & Spivak ( in press ) .
Briefly , three spatial transformations were computed for each dog : ( 1 ) rigid - body mean EPI to high - resolution structural ( 6 dof ) ; ( 2 ) affine structural to template ( 12 dof ) ; and ( 3 ) diffeomorphic structural to template .
Spatial transformations were then concatenated and applied to individual contrasts obtained from the above - described GLM model .
This allowed the computation of group level statistics .
For group - level statistics , a high - resolution MRI beagle brain atlas was used as the template ( Datta et al . , 2012 ) .
AFNI ’ s 3dttest + + was then used to compute a t - test across dogs with the null hypothesis that each voxel had a mean value of zero .
All twelve dogs were used in this group analysis .
The group contrast we conducted was reward - no reward ( across all source conditions ) , computed as the contrast [ ( Rewfam + Rewunf + Rewcom ) ] − [ ( noRewfam + noRewunf + noRewcom ) ] .
The same approach was taken to compute the group PPI results .
Instead of a contrast , the beta values for the interaction term ( computed between stimulus presentation schedule and caudate time series ) from each individual dog were entered into a second - level model using 3dttest + + .
For both the primary GLM and the PPI analysis , we then calculated the average smoothness of the residuals using 3dFWHMx and then used 3dClustsim to estimate the significance of different cluster sizes across the whole brain after correcting for familywise error ( FWE ) .
Results
Mean scan - to - scan movement across all sources ( familiar and unfamiliar human and computer ) and signals ( reward and no - reward ) was 0.94 mm .
In a repeated measures ANOVA , source was a significant predictor of motion ( F ( 2 ) = 44.6 , p < 0.001 ) , with motion lower in the familiar handler source than the other two .
Signal , however , was not a significant predictor of motion ( F ( 1 ) = 0.9 , p = 0.366 ) , nor was the interaction of source and signal ( F ( 2 ) = 0.08 , p = 0.928 ) .
This paralleled the findings from a repeated measures ANOVA examining the percentage of volumes censored across all source and signal conditions .
In the latter , source was a significant predictor of censoring ( F ( 2 ) = 16.2 , p < 0.001 ) , while signal was not ( F ( 1 ) = 1.0 , p = 0.333 ) , nor was the interaction of source and signal ( F ( 2 ) = 2.0 , p = 0.156 ) .
Whole - brain group analysis of ( reward - no - reward ) hand signals collapsed across all three source conditions ( familiar human , unfamiliar human , and computer ) yielded robust and significant bilateral ventral caudate activation .
With a single - voxel significance of 0.005 , the cluster , which corrected FWE across the whole brain , was p = 0.01 ( Fig . 4 ) .
In the four - factor PCA of the 14 temperament factors from the C - BARQ questionnaire ( Table 2 ) , the first factor accounted for 31.1 % of variance , the second for 17.5 % , the third for 15.0 % and the fourth for 13.3 % of variance ( accounting cumulatively for 76.9 % of total variance ) .
Of note , the first factor appeared to strongly represent aggressivity , while the second was associated with attachment and separation .
Weighting of C - BARQ PCA factors .
In the mixed - effects ANOVA model without temperament included , the interaction of source and signal was not a significant predictor of caudate activation ( F ( 2 , 67.7 ) = 1.619 , p = 0.206 ) .
However , in the mixed - effects ANOVA model with the four temperament factors included , signal was a significant predictor ( F ( 1 , 88.6 ) = 19.3 , p < 0.001 ) , the interaction of source and signal was a significant predictor ( F ( 2 , 61.8 ) = 3.6 , p < 0.05 ) , the interaction of source and C - BARQ factor 1 was a significant predictor ( F ( 2 , 61.8 ) = 11.6 , p < 0.001 ) , the interaction of source with signal and C - Barq factor 1 was a significant predictor ( F ( 2 , 61.8 ) = 29.9 , p < 0.001 ) , the interaction of source with C - BARQ factor 2 was a significant predictor ( F ( 2 , 61.8 ) = 13.6 , p < 0.001 ) , the interaction of source with C - BARQ factor 3 was a significant predictor ( F ( 2 , 61.8 ) = 4.9 , p = 0.01 ) , and the interaction between source , signal , and C - BARQ factor 3 was a significant predictor ( F ( 2 , 61.8 ) = 19.3 , p < 0.001 ) .
Neither C - BARQ factor 4 , nor any of its interactions , were significant predictors of caudate activation .
For further analysis we focused on C - BARQ factor 1 .
C - BARQ factor 2 did not show a significant interaction with signal , and C - BARQ factor 3 was dominated by the trainability metric from the C - BARQ questionnaire .
The values for our dogs showed very limited range in this metric , and did not match with independent assessments of actual trainability by the authors ( two of whom have extensive animal training experience ) ( Fig . 5 ) .
Functional connectivity group analysis revealed bilateral clusters of increased activation , in the left posterior suprasylvian region corresponding to the right caudate seed , and in the right posterior suprasylvian region corresponding to the left caudate seed ( Fig . 6 ) .
Both clusters were significant at voxelwise p < 0.05 ( 321 voxels for the left posterior suprasylvian region , 565 voxels for the right posterior suprasylvian region ) , but do not survive thresholding with whole - brain corrected FWE at p < 0.10 .
Discussion
Here we showed that , across 12 dogs , the caudate was differentially active for reward vs . no - reward signals when analyzed at the group level .
Findings controlled for confounding effects from motion , censoring , and physiological changes .
This builds on our previous findings showing differential caudate activation for a similar task at the individual subject level ( Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2012 ; Berns , Brooks & Spivak , 2013 ) .
Given this robust group finding , and the extensive literature linking caudate activation to reward anticipation ( Montague & Berns , 2002 ; Schultz , Dayan & Montague , 1997 ; Knutson et al . , 2001 ) , the current experiment provides the most definitive evidence to date that fMRI with unrestrained , awake dogs can yield reliable and valid data .
Moreover , the current results emphasize the importance of the source of information to the dogs and how this interacts with their temperaments .
Our primary interest in the current experiment was to explore the effect of signal source on reward processing and the extent it matters to a dog whether a reward or no - reward signal comes from a familiar or an unfamiliar human , or from a human or a computer .
If behavioral and neural response to reward signals are merely products of specific reinforcement history , dogs should not strongly differentiate signals with the same meaning across different source conditions .
Differential caudate activation is a reliable way to probe these questions , and can be interpreted as a marker of positive salience even in the absence of a specific behavior ( Ariely & Berns , 2010 ; Bartra , McGuire & Kable , 2013 ) .
Brain data now confirms prior behavioral evidence indicating that dogs can generalize meaningful signals when produced by unfamiliar humans , and that they can learn and respond to meaningful signals produced by computers .
When examined in a mixed - effects model including signal type and signal source , the difference between reward and no - reward signals in the caudate was not significantly different across the three sources .
However , including a factor representative of a key attribute of canine temperament ( aggressivity ) revealed significant interactions between signal source and temperament .
In other words , signal source does matter to dogs , and apparently quite strongly - but the way in which it matters is highly dependent on the dog ’ s temperament .
Specifically , dogs with lower aggressivity showed a higher differential caudate response to reward versus no - reward signals from their handlers , while dogs with higher aggressivity showed a higher differential caudate response to reward versus no - reward signals from the unfamiliar humans and the computer .
It must be noted that “ low ” and “ high ” aggressivity measures here are relative to our sample - none of our subjects scored particularly high on C - BARQ aggressivity measures .
Moreover , the differences in caudate activation were not due simply to changes in physiological arousal as these were controlled by the inclusion of a physiological proxy vis - a - vis an ROI in the CSF .
Nor were the caudate differences due to motion because there was no significant difference in scan - to - scan motion of reward vs . no reward signals across the 3 sources .
Interestingly , the differences in caudate activation were not correlated with the C - BARQ factors for attachment and separation .
The interrelation of individual differences and neurological and behavioral responses is foundational to contemporary human psychology ( e.g. , Depue & Collins , 1999 ; Ajzen , 2005 ) .
Although less studied , there is still substantial work examining temperament in non - human animals ( Gosling & John , 1999 ) , much of it recently in dogs ( Jones & Gosling , 2005 ; Taylor & Mills , 2006 ; De Meester et al . , 2011 ; Dowling - Guyer , Marder & D ’ arpino , 2011 ) , and strong evidence indicates that , just as in humans , temperament is an important factor affecting neural and behavioral response in different contexts .
Our current finding , that the caudates of dogs with lower aggressivity respond more strongly to reward versus no - reward signals from familiar handlers while those of dogs with higher aggressivity respond more strongly to unfamiliar humans , is in line with prior literature on striatal reward processing .
Striatal response to reward depends heavily on salience ( Zink et al . , 2004 ) , and anxiety predisposes one to attend to possible threat ( MacLeod & Mathews , 1988 ) .
Dogs who show higher aggressivity may be more aroused or more anxious in the presence of a stranger than with a familiar handler , and this likely increases the salience of the unfamiliar human , and thus the striatal activation to reward .
Dogs with lower aggressivity , on the other hand , may find their owner relatively more salient due to prior history of interaction and reward .
As a side note , we cannot fully rule out differences in training approaches used by individual handlers as a possible contributor to our findings - it is plausible that dogs with different temperament may elicit different training approaches from their handlers .
However , all dogs were trained to a similar criterion of task success using the same general approach , with biweekly oversight by project staff , over roughly the same amount of time .
Because the training for this task was , at essence , very simple ( repeated exposures leading to classical conditioning of the reward and no reward cues ) , it seems unlikely that slight differences in training would account for the results reported here .
Due to our relatively large dataset ( 90 10 s trials per dog across all three source conditions ) we were also able to conduct a PPI connectivity analysis to look for brain regions that increased functional coupling with the caudate at the group level on reward versus no - reward trials .
Functional connectivity analysis with the right and left caudate seeds highlighted contralateral cortical patches ( right for the left caudate seed and left for the right caudate seed ) in the posterior suprasylvian region .
There is no prior work on this region in canines , but there is a substantial literature in cats , who , as carnivores , are fairly closely related to dogs .
Evidence suggests the posterior suprasylvian region in carnivores is a downstream visual area necessary for learning and discriminating between novel visual stimuli ( Markuszka , 1978 ; Updyke , 1986 ; Lomber , Payne & Cornwell , 1996 ) .
The posterior suprasylvian region in cats is functionally analogous to inferotemporal cortex in primates , which is also shown to play an integral role in learning new visual associations , including for faces ( Horel et al . , 1987 ) .
In addition , the posterior suprasylvian region in cats and the inferotemporal region in primates have been shown to share strong connections with the striatum ( Yeterian & Hoesen , 1978 ; Royce , 1982 ; Webster , Bachevalier & Ungerleider , 1993 ) .
Given this , a possible interpretation of our current connectivity findings is that the caudate and posterior suprasylvian regions differentially coupled contralaterally to support contextual visual learning related to reward anticipation .
This is particularly likely given that testing occurred in a novel environment , and , in the case of the stranger source condition , with a novel signal giver ( likely with their own slight idiosyncrasies in signal presentation ) .
In other words , visual features of the signal and signal presentation at MRI were subtly different from those previously experienced by our subjects , likely leading to additional learning about what contexts , signals , and signal givers might lead to reward .
Due to the fairly low statistical threshold of these findings , they should be taken as descriptive and suggestive as opposed to conclusive , but , due to the lack of connectivity data in canines , are still of interest .
In brief , we demonstrated a robust bilateral differential caudate activation to reward versus no reward signals at the group level in 12 dogs across three source conditions .
Further , a measure of temperament , specifically aggressivity , was a strong predictor of differential caudate response across the three source conditions .
A condition - specific functional connectivity analysis indicated increased contralateral coupling between the right and left caudate and visual learning brain regions .
These findings provide new understanding of reward processing in the domestic dog and contribute to a growing body of research on individual differences in non - human animals .
Particularly notable is the explanatory power of a temperament measure in explaining the neural response .
It is likely that there are substantial individual differences in how different dogs will react across a range of contexts , and future research and applied work should be sensitive to this , particularly when making broad claims based on findings across a group of dogs whose temperament has not been assessed .
BOLD signal in the caudate may serve as a predictive measure of dog temperament and amenability to different training approaches , although , due to the difficulty and expense of fMRI , application in the near term would likely be restricted to special instances ( e.g. , assessment of military or service dogs ) .

Introduction
The most common manifestation of JC virus in HIV infected patients is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) but recent case reports and studies have shown another manifestation called granule cell neuronopathy [1-4] .
In this debilitating condition , JC virus infects the granule cells of the cerebellum causing cerebellum degeneration [4] .
We report a case featuring a HIV patient with possible granule cell neuronopathy showing the classical symptoms of cerebellar dysfunction .

Case Report
A 50 - year - old Hispanic female presented with a three - day history of bilateral lower extremity and left - upper extremity weakness .
She had fallen once at home and was no longer ambulatory due to weakness by the time of admission .
The patient had bronchial asthma and had multiple hospitalizations due to exacerbations in the past .
She was diagnosed with HIV in 1993 and had been noncompliant with HIV treatment previously .
Most recently , she had several months of compliance on HAART therapy that comprised of elvitegravir , cobicistat , emtricitabine , and tenofovir .
At the time of this admission , the patient was alert , awake , oriented , afebrile , and hemodynamically stable .
She appeared dehydrated , weak , and cachectic .
Respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were within normal limits .
Despite complaints of weakness , neurological examination showed 5 / 5 strength in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally .
She had normal deep tendon reflexes , flexor - plantar reflexes , and no sensory deficits .
She had a wide - based gait , abnormal dysmetria , abnormal heel - knee - shin test , and dysdiadochokinesia on the left side .
She was unable to maintain her balance when rising .
Examination of cranial nerves did not show abnormalities except slight weakness of CN XI on the left side , revealed by testing the trapezius and the sternocleidomastoid muscles .
The patient was not able to fully raise her left shoulder or turn her head to the left side against resistance .
Her CD 4 T - cell and viral load , drawn the previous month , were 114 / mm and 194,000 , respectively .
Complete blood count and serum chemistry were within normal range .
The patient ' s ALT , AST , and alkaline phosphatase levels were elevated twofold , most likely due to HAART .
During this admission , CT scan of the head showed an area of focal low attenuation in the left cerebellum .
T2 weighted MRI showed a 2 cm region of hyperintensity in the left inferior cerebellar hemisphere involving the cortex and underlying white matter ( Figure 1 ) .
Serological tests for HSV 1 , HSV 2 , and syphilis were negative .
A CSF obtained via spinal tap was clear in appearance and contained glucose : 45 mg / dL , protein : 92 mg / dL , RBC : 2 / mm , and WBC 71 / mm ( lymphocytes : 97 , polys : 0 , monocytes : 3 , eosinophils : 0 ) .
The CSF was also VDRL negative and negative for cryptococcal antigen .
The culture revealed no growth .
The CSF PCR assay was negative for HSV 1 and HSV 2 but positive for JC virus ( 1,276 copies ) .
The clinical impression was for JC - virus CNS infection and granule cell neuronopathy .

It is usually acquired in childhood or adolescence , and approximately 70 to 90 percent of the human population carries the virus [4-6] .
The virus remains dormant , mostly in the kidneys and lymphoid organs of the host , but may reactivate , spread to the brain , and induce neuronolysis in immunosuppressed patients [ 1 , 4 ] .
JC virus reactivation occurs most frequently in patients with HIV / AIDS but also in transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy , patients on chemotherapy , and multiple sclerosis patients undergoing natalizumab treatment [1] .
Clinical manifestations of the JC virus include classic progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( PML - IRIS ) , JC virus encephalopathy , JC virus meningitis , and the newly discovered JC virus granule cell neuronopathy [1] .
Granule cell neuronopathy is sometimes associated with PML but is a distinct clinical entity [ 1 , 4 ] .
In granule cell neuronopathy , the JC virus induces grey - matter degeneration but does not affect purkinje - cell fibers [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 ] .
The exact nature of the mechanism of Purkinje cell sparing is poorly understood [ 2 , 4 ] .
Recent research has shown that granule cell neuronopathy is a chronic , lytic infection of granule cell neurons in the cerebellum where the diseased granule cells present with hypochromatic , enlarged nuclei [ 2 , 4 ] .
It can occur in isolation or concomitantly with classic PML [4] .
The major symptoms are cerebellar signs including ataxic gate , dysdiadochokinesia , abnormal finger to nose test , and heel - knee - shin test [ 2 , 3 ] .
MRI typically shows atrophy of the cerebellum and lesions within the cerebellum .
Immunohistochemistry must be performed on brain - biopsy tissue , which was unavailable in this case , to make a definitive diagnosis of this condition [2-4] .
In this patient , the possibility of granule cell neuronopathy is most likely but the role of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) cannot be ruled without a cerebellum biopsy and subsequent immunohistochemistry workup to show granule cell degeneration .
As mentioned before , the patient was recently restarted on HAART therapy .
IRIS is demonstrated when the CD 4 T - cell counts increase and immunity is recently restored ; a paradoxical worsening of the condition is seen with inflammatory reaction in brain lesions [ 1 , 3 ] .
The inflammatory reaction can be demonstrated by contrast enhancement on MRI , which is also seen in our patient ' s MRI [1] .
A compilation of previous case reports found in the literature on JC virus granule cell neuronopathy including demographics , clinical findings , treatments , and the overall outcome is shown in Table 1 .
The median survival of patients with granule cell neuronopathy is approximately 3 months without HAART therapy and up to 1.8 years in patients on HAART therapy or possibly more depending on CD 4 response .
HAART therapy increases the T - cell counts in modest amount and is a reliable measure in controlling this disease [ 2 , 3 ] .
Shows the demographic and clinical findings , treatment , and outcome of JC virus granule cell neuronopathy reported in the literature .
Address for correspondence : Context :
Impact of disability is deleterious , affecting an individual ' s every aspect .
Majority of disabled reside in rural areas of developing countries .
Moreover , different types of disability add to its wide spectrum .
All these make it a major health issue .
Aims :
The aim of this study was to note the prevalence rate and pattern of locomotor disability in a rural population of Jodhpur District and to observe its impact on mobility , self - care , and interpersonal skills of disabled .
Settings :
This study was carried out in rural field practice area of the Community and Family Medicine Department of tertiary care setup .
Design :
This was a cross - sectional study .
Materials and Methods :
House - to - house survey for a sample size of 1656 was conducted by a team of trained doctors , therapists , and anganwadi workers for identification of locomotor disability applying a pretested survey questionnaire .
Statistical Analysis :
SPSS version 22 was used for descriptive analysis of variables ( frequency distribution ) , and the Chi - squared test was used for the association of sociodemographic factors with performance qualifier score .
Results :
The prevalence rate of 2.08 % for locomotor disability ( male = 57 % and female = 43 % ) was noted , with 31 % from 40 to 60 years , 49 % were illiterate , and 60 % were from lower class .
The main etiologies were cerebrovascular accident ( 25 % ) and cerebral palsy ( 23 % ) .
About 80 % faced some difficulties in mobility domain , 57 % in self - care , and 63 % in interpersonal skills .
Statistically significant association was seen for self - care domain with education level ( P = 0.04 ) and for interpersonal skill domain with age groups and diagnosis ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.035 , respectively ) .
Conclusion :
The overall prevalence of locomotor disability in rural Jodhpur was 2.08 % , higher for males and higher from 40 to 60 years .
Most disabled were illiterate and were from low socioeconomic status .
Self - care , mobility , and interpersonal skills were primarily affected and require proper intervention .

Disability is an important public health issue [1] .
It is defined as any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in a manner or within the range considered normal for human beings , resulting from impairment of an organ [1] .
Disability is complicated by additional medical , psychological , or environmental factors and can significantly affect the quality of life [2] .
The social and cultural consequences of a disability lead to handicap of an individual [1] .
According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , about 15 % of the world ' s population is estimated to be living with disability with higher occurrence in developing countries such as India , with majority of them residing in rural areas [3] .
The global population estimated in 2010 showed around 785 - 795 million persons aged 15 years and older to be living with disability [2] .
According to the National Sample Survey Organization ( NSSO ) , the number of disabled persons in India constituted about 2 % of the total population with a total of 14,085,000 disabled residing in rural areas and 4,406,000 disabled in urban areas [4] .
Among different types of disabilities , the prevalence for locomotor disability was noted to be highest in the country - 1046 in rural and 901 in urban per 100,000 persons [4] .
Of these , about 13 % were severely disabled as they could not perform self - care , even with aid / appliance [4] .
The Annual Health Survey 2012 - 2013 for Rajasthan state suggested total disability prevalence of 2350 persons / 100,000 population in rural areas of the state and 1697 persons / 100,000 population in Jodhpur rural regions [5] .
Disability limitation through early rehabilitative measures can minimize its impact and improve community participation [4] .
Both early detection of disability and early rehabilitative intervention are essential to improve health outcomes , increase the accessibility to educational institutions , enhance the economic participation , and reduce the poverty rates and thereby decrease their dependency on nondisabled population [3] .
However , only 2 % of the disabled persons have access to rehabilitative services in India [2,6] .
Moreover , the awareness of rehabilitation services is equally limited , especially in rural areas [6] .
Thus , the present study was designed to note the prevalence pattern of locomotor disability in rural population of Jodhpur District and its impact on activity and participation of these disabled individuals .

A descriptive study ( cross - sectional observational type ) was carried out in rural field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Medicine , namely Center for Rural Health AIIMS ( CRHA ) at Keru and Dhundhara from October 1 , 2016 , to December 31 , 2016 .
Ethical clearance was obtained beforehand from the Institutional Ethical Committee at All India Institute of Medical Sciences , Jodhpur .
The purpose of the study was explained to individuals during the survey .
Written informed consent was obtained from individuals who agreed to participate in the study , and subsequently , information was collected from these individuals .
Optimal sampling size was calculated on basis of prior prevalence rate of locomotor disability of 1046 / 100,000 persons in rural population as reported by the NSSO [4] .
The sample size was calculated by the formula 4PQ / L2 where P was prevalence ( 1.046 ) , Q is 100 − P = 98.954 , and L was fixed error , that is , 5 % .
The sample size was estimated to be 1656 .
Keeping the average family size of six members as noted in rural population of southwestern Rajasthan , 280 houses were selected ( 140 house in Keru and 140 in Dhundhara ) through random sampling method .
The house - to - house survey was conducted by a team of trained doctors , therapists , and anganwadi workers for identification of locomotor disability .
For maintaining uniformity in identification , the operational definition of locomotor disability as mentioned by the NSSO was used [4] .
According to the NSSO , a locomotor disabled person includes those with loss or absence or inactivity of whole or part of limb ( s ) due to amputation , paralysis , deformity , or dysfunction of joints affecting normal ability to move him / her or move objects ; born disabled persons ; and those with physical deformities in body ( other than limbs ) , such as deformities of spine like hunch back , scoliosis etc . , and persons with stiff neck of permanent nature would also be included [4] .
The pattern of disability was measured through a predesigned , pretested pro - forma as used by Mahmood et al [7] .
Out of the pretested pro - forma , the first section which explored the sociodemographic characteristics was used [7] .
Further , the impact of disability was measured using activity - participation subsection of the International Classification of Functioning , Disability , and Health ( ICF ) checklist version 2.1a [8] .
ICF was developed by the WHO to study the impact of health on daily activities .
It is a practical tool to elicit and record information on functional aspects of disability for an individual .
Performance qualifier indicates the extent of participation restriction by describing a person ' s actual performance of a task or action in his or her current environment [8] .
Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Version 22.0 , Armonk , NY , IBM Corp . Released 2013 .
Frequency and percentage distribution was calculated for demographic variables and performance qualifier score was attained for the disabled study population .
The association of sociodemographic factors with performance qualifier score for domain of mobility , self - care , and interpersonal skill was calculated using the Chi - squared test .
R
Of 280 houses ( 140 in each center ) , a total of 35 cases of disability were observed with a prevalence rate of 2083 / 100,000 ( 2.08 % ) .
Of these , 20 were male and 15 were female .
Nearly one - third ( 11 of 35 ) belonged to the age group of 40 - 60 years .
Half of them ( 49 % ) were illiterate and 60 % belonged to lower socioeconomic class .
The average family size in the current study was noted as 7 .
Table 1 represents the socioeconomic and demographic profile of these 35 persons .
The main causes for locomotor disability were cerebrovascular accident ( n = 9 , 25 % ) and cerebral palsy ( n = 8 , 23 % ) .
The remaining etiologies are elaborated in Table 2 .
Demographic profile of persons with locomotor disability observed in the study ( n = 35 )
Etiological distribution of locomotor disability
Among them , 28 persons ( 80 % ) faced some difficulties in the mobility domain and 20 persons ( 57 % ) in the self - care domain .
In interpersonal skills , 5 children could not be included since the questions in subset were not applicable to them .
In this domain , 19 of 30 ( 63 % ) faced difficulty due to their disability .
The distribution based on the severity of difficulty for the three domains is represented in Table 3 .

The association of three domains with the socioeconomic and demographic factors is mentioned in Table 4 .
The self - care domain showed statistically significant association with education level ( P = 0.04 ) .
For interpersonal skill domain , age group and diagnosis were statistically significant with P value as 0.022 and 0.035 , respectively .
Mobility domain did not show any statistically significant association with any of the factors .

The current study reported a prevalence rate of 2.08 % for locomotor disability in Jodhpur District .
The previous studies by Ganesh et al . , Borker et al . , Padhyegurjar et al . , Suganthi and Kandaswamy , and Mahmood et al . have shown a varied range of prevalence rate of 1.8 % in rural Karnataka , 0.92 % in rural Goa , 5.57 % in Mumbai slums , 0.91 % in rural Puducherry , and 3.7 % in rural Uttar Pradesh for locomotor disability , respectively [7] .
Although locomotor disability is considered to be the most prevalent disability according to the NSSO , the prevalence rate of 1 % was mentioned [4] .
This wide variation in the reported prevalence rates could be due to numerous reasons .
One possible reason is the difference in operational definitions of locomotor disability , different methodologies of data collection , and variation in the quality of study design .
Moreover , the different sociocultural background and different risk factors prevailing in a particular region may influence the variation in rate [2] .
Further , according to the WHO 2005 , there has been an increase in a number of disabled people because of increase in accidents , infectious diseases , malnutrition , chronic diseases , substance abuse , war injuries , population growth , and medical advances [1] .
The difficulty in identifying mild and moderate degrees of physical and mental disability , even by health - care members , not only leads to many cases being missed but also enhances the variation [4] .
The pattern of locomotor disability was assessed according to gender , education level , socioeconomic status , monthly income , age group , and predominant etiology .
The current study showed a higher prevalence rate in males ( 57 % ) in comparison to females ( 43 % ) , similar to the findings in NSSO and studies by Srivastava et al . in Uttar Pradesh , Suganthi and Kandaswamy in rural Puducherry , and Mahmood et al . in rural Bareilly [4,7,12,13] .
As per the NSSO , 54.7 % of disabled were illiterate which matches trend observed in this study , with 49 % disabled persons being illiterate [4] .
A significantly higher prevalence of disabilities ( 60 % ) was seen in lower socioeconomic class with monthly income < 10,000 INR for 57 % of the disabled in the current study .
This is in concordance with the previous studies by Pati , Ganesh et al . , Borker et al . , Padhyegurjar et al . , Suganthi and Kandaswamy , and Mahmood et al [7,9,10,11,12,14] .
The reason for this replicated finding is the two - way causation between the intricately related phenomena of disability and poverty .
Persons with poor resources and low income have lesser accessibility and affordability for health facilities and rehabilitation services .
Inaccessible physical environment also restricts their participation in community and confines these disabled persons to their homes .
Lower education level leads to low awareness about opportunities and available policy benefits .
All these further lower their standard of living and socioeconomic status leading to a vicious cycle [15] .
In the current study , the locomotor disability was predominant in those older than 40 years , with nearly one - third ( 31 % ) in the age group of 40 - 60 years .
However , no particular trend was observed in relation to various age groups .
A similar finding was noted by Suganthi and Kandaswamy [12] .
The etiology of disability in this study was mainly cerebrovascular accident and cerebral palsy .
This is dissimilar to the previous studies .
Suganthi and Kandaswamy in their study found congenital causes ( 18.9 % ) , residual paralysis ( 18.9 % ) , and stroke ( 16.2 % ) as the three leading causes [12] .
In the NSSO and the study by Kar in West Bengal , leading cause of locomotor disability was residual paralysis due to polio in rural ( 29.5 % ) areas [4,16] .
This implies a change in the trend in the past one decade with a decline in the polio - related disability and successful implementation of immunization program .
The rise in noncommunicable disease as a causative factor for disability is reflected in this study .
Cerebrovascular accident was also seen as a leading cause of disability in the elderly in the study by Borker et al . in Goa [10] .
The study also explored the impact of locomotor disability on various day - to - day tasks using ICF domains .
It was found that locomotor disability primarily affected domains of mobility and self - care , with nearly 80 % and 57 % facing some difficulties in these domains .
This also restricted interpersonal interaction in 63 % .
The impact is obvious since locomotor impairment will influence movement and inability to move will hinder in self - care .
The self - care domain showed a stronger association with education level , which is obvious .
An educated disabled person or educated family members will be more aware of the importance of self - care and hence emphasize on it either by performing it for the person or ensuring a setup where the basic self - care tasks are heeded .
Interpersonal interaction showed a significant association with age groups and diagnosis .
Based on the diagnosis , the comorbidities may be variable and may not affect only the locomotor system .
A patient with cerebrovascular accident and cerebral palsy may have associated speech and cognitive difficulties and hence affect the interpersonal interactions .
Furthermore , interactive skills decline over the years with the elderly having a poor social circle and often being isolated .
Previous studies related to disability among the elderly have revealed that increasing age tends to be associated with increased risk of functional disability [17] .
Although mobility domain is affected , it did not show any association with any of these demographic factors .
This could be because of the small sample size .
Another possibility may be that mobility difficulties are experienced uniformly irrespective of gender , age , education level , and socioeconomic status in those persons with locomotor disability .
Preventive and rehabilitative measures at an early stage can limit disability and handicap [3,4] .
However , nonavailability , nonaccessibility , and poor awareness of rehabilitation services among these unreached disabled persons living in rural areas and small towns is a big challenge in developing countries like India [3] .
Other major considerations include the utilization of available rehabilitation services and their cost - effectiveness .
In spite of available government programs and policies providing income assistance and work - related supports to the disabled , awareness regarding them is low among the disabled [2,3,18] .
The rehabilitation provided so far by the institute , where the current study was conducted , has been institutional - based type , benefitting those who avail such facilities at the tertiary care .
However , these individuals are often neglected in the community because of inaccessibility and lack of awareness of rehabilitation services , leading to their limited utilization .
Hence , systematic research into prevalence pattern and determinants of disability is essential to develop rehabilitation programs , relevant to a given contextual scenario in this particular region of the country .
This facilitates social re - integration of the disabled into the given community context smoothly in due course of time .
The current study helped us to know the problem present in the community in the region surrounding the institute , providing data from rural setup .
It not only revealed the magnitude but also the factors associated with disability .
It also stratified major functional domains in which an individual with locomotor disability may face issues with .
Based on these findings , rehabilitation modules for three most common conditions , i.e. , cerebrovascular accident , cerebral palsy , and osteoarthritis , are being designed .
These modules will be easily understandable and simple enough to be implemented by any health care professional even at primary health center level .
In this way , personals working at the primary health care level can provide and support initiatives of limiting disabilities and preventing the handicap of an individual .
Thus , the out - reach programs would address the accessibility issue and enhance awareness of rehabilitation services among the rural disabled persons .
Only then , the challenges brought by a disability can be combated at large .
The study had its limitations of exploring locomotor disability in rural regions of the district and not including the urban regions which may have a different pattern and impact of the disability on individuals .
Furthermore , it was focused to a specific region leading to difficulty in generalization of the findings to other populations in India , due to vast difference in living conditions and variations in accessibility to health facilities across the country .
The impact of disability was noted in only three domains of the ICF checklist , and other components such as domestic life , employment , and social / civic life were not studied .
C R
The prevalence of locomotor disability in rural Jodhpur was noted as 2.08 % , higher for males and higher from 40 to 60 years .
Most disabled were illiterate and were from low socioeconomic status .
Self - care , mobility , and interpersonal skills were primarily affected and require proper intervention .
Thus , a systematic research into pattern and determinants of disability with stratification of functional domains affected may help formulate outreach rehabilitation programs relevant in a given contextual environment .
This can not only limit the impact of disability but also address the accessibility issue and enhance rehabilitation awareness in a given region .
Moreover , the primary health - care system can play a major role in these outreach services to combat disability at large .
Studies observing the prevalence pattern in urban areas in the given region , impact of disability on remaining domains of ICF checklist , and effectiveness of outreach programs in the rural region can be explored in future .
